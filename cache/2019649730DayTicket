Specifically none of the apps loaded into our console are installing correctly(or at all) on newly enrolled devices. This is the second major issue in the past 7 days that has prevented us from being able to use AirWatch to deploy new devices and to make matters worse, I was informed by the support rep I spoke with that this was an issue they found earlier in the day and that there has been an email thread discussing various issues with cn274. In the future I would expect that we are notified as soon as an issue is discovered, as we potentially have to delay our orders of new phones due to this issue.\n\nI also have received no follow up on my previous email. Please advise when this new issue will be resolved.\n\nNick Albury\n\nMobile Device Manager\n\nnickalbury@handy.com\n\n<image001.png>\n\nIn the news: Handybook Rebrands As Handy (TechCrunch (http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/16/handybook-rebrands-as-handy/))\n\nWe're hiring!

We only support the infrastructure if the SEG is set up by our deployment team (purchase required) or by himself if it is up and running correctly.\nSo please speak to professional service regarding this. Also, I would also ask about load balancer setup and whether we can configure it for them( I think we do but I am not certain). And please mention it is for DR.\n\nPlease let me know how I should proceed with my support ticket later.\n\nThank you!\nZee Wang\nProfessional Services and Support\nO| 470.247.6867\nC | 678.793.5903\nzhihanwang@air-watch.com<mailto:zhihanwang@air-watch.com>\nwww.air-watch.com<http://www.air-watch.com/>\nInteract with AirWatch via Twitter<https://twitter.com/AirWatch>, LinkedIn<http://www.linkedin.com/company/283586?trk=tyah> and Google+<https://plus.google.com/u/0/106579500291096176030/posts>\n[AirWatch - We Simplify Enterprise Mobility]<http://www.air-watch.com/>\nThis communication is confidential and is intended to be privileged pursuant to applicable law.

This was diagnosed to be client side code.\n\nI did some checking and I am not sure this is related since when I profile the Devices-List view page, about 75% (or more) of page load time is spent on client side rendering individual elements in the list eg:\n- i have a customer with only 4 devices in the list and it takes 2-3 seconds to load the page\n- i have another customer with 28 devices and it takes 6 seconds\n- If I go to AirWatch Internal where there are 111 devices, it takes 11-14 seconds to load the list consistently the first time and a refresh takes longer but the render time is consistently 8-10 seconds of the total.\n\nI think if someone from the front-end team takes a look they may be able to quickly find some optimizations for the list pages ( devices, accounts, content, etc) which avoid the circular rendering issues with associated wait times (each element render includes about 100ms of idle time for some reason which could be the whole issue). See the attached screen shot as well as the related data.  \n\n\n- \n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:  go to the AirWatch Internal site and click on the devices - List view and see that it is slow.   Then go to any other Group Id which has less devices and do the same.  It will run proportionally faster because of less devices.\n\n\n\n- \n\n**Troubleshooting steps already attempted**:   See attached screen shot of performance profiling. and data\n\n- \n\n**Screenshots & Logs** (i.e. affected documents or internal applications):attached\n\n- \n\n**Additional Notes / Information**\n\nI believe that the client side code is making a call to the server for each device node.  I don't have a full diagnostics setup on my macbook air to test this.  If this is the case, to fix all you need to do is pull the information for the full list on the screen as one query and put it in local storage (or a local object in memory for each page - limited to 100 items to preserver memory).  At this point there will be no latency and no idle time for each div when it renders.\n\nIf this same approach is taken on all pages which have lists (Devices, Accounts, Content, etc.) this will go a long way to making the console more responsive.\n\n- \n\n##########################################","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":611418698,"submitter_id":611418698,"assignee_id":486185623,"organization_id":20196497,"group_id":21574653,"collaborator_ids":[117831927],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["account_management","awid_cust","awid_pt_asp","awid_pt_gen","awid_pt_rsl","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_awp","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_ft","kb_pa","kb_pt","kb_pt_asp","kb_pt_ms","kb_pt_pd"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":""},{"id":20280868,"value":"account_management"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":""},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":""},{"id":20280868,"value":"account_management"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":""},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/467544.json","id":467544,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"jamesboles@air-watch.com","name":"James Boles"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-11-21T15:36:15Z","updated_at":"2014-11-21T15:37:30Z","type":"task","subject":"Linkus Enterprises - Green Secure Launcher Deployment + Secure Browser","raw_subject":"Linkus Enterprises - Green Secure Launcher Deployment + Secure Browser","description":"Hello Installs,\n\nI am writing to initiate the deployment of Linkus Enterprises. https://na3.salesforce.com/0065000000TD6MA\n\nThere is a very high sense of urgency for this deployment.
