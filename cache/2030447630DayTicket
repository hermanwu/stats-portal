The customer also mentions her Private app isn't updating as well in the Console.\n\nFor the most part, in interviewing the customer it sounds like the customers end users are accessing the Google Play Private channel service directly instead of going through the Console in which I'll have to educate this customer.\n\nAlso, taking a look at the customers environment and settings I don't think she has the Google Play integration set up properly to use Google Play Private channel service which, brings us to my short list of questions below...\n\n1. Essentially, the Google Play Private channel integration should work the same way a the public Google Play integration right ?\n\n2 .Organizations using the Google Play private channel should have their end users access the AirWatch app catalog instead of the Google Play private channel directly when down loading apps-correct ?\n\n3. Within the Consoles Google Play integration page I'm thinking and was previously told that the Google account user name  and the password (Phone/tablet) would be the credentials of the publisher/administrator of the Google Play private channel rather than the credentials of a public Google ID. However, what about the Android device field is this field required by the Console for the Private Google channel service. I don't have a Google Private Channel account but, it doesn't appear a device is associated with this type of service as with the public accounts .\n\n4. Which brings me to my next question, from what I've typically seen the Google Play integration in the Console  it was designed to interact with the public side of Google play and most of the configuration setting seem to lean more towards public Google apps however, is the Console fully compatible with the private Google Play channel or can it be used with Google's Play private channel service?\n\n5. Furthermore, I see that the customer has managed to upload a private app from Googles Private channel into the public apps section of the Console.

Ajay and I were able to get that up and running. To get my phone up and running, I needed to totally remove the device management and the AirWatch agent, and reinstall everything. It appeared that this brought my phone into the AirWatch system correctly. The goal was to let my phone work with the controlling software, and see if it would stay connected. So far that’s working.\n\nUnfortunately, this means that we need to do this with the 15 phones that we’ve already deployed, and that are scattered across the region. Ajay worked to get a document together so that we ‘may’ have our remote users try to reinstall the agent. The majority of our guys are ‘flip phone’ capable, so we may have to wait 6 months until they are back for training to get them all up and running… Yesterday Ajay provided that document, and I’ve not had time to review it yet.\n\nSince we’ve really not had any good luck with the management profiles, we’d like to see the next batch of phones, that will be deployed next week, all progress through the installation process correctly before this gets hammered closed. If we can get this next group of 8 to all install, accept all of the profiles, react correctly to the white/black application lists, and not allow the user to remove the agent, we’ll call this a success, and move on…\n\nThese will be installed this week, so keep your fingers crossed and watch for any failures.\n\nThanks,\n\nMark\nHi ,\n\nDo we have any update on this ?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nDeekshita Bhuyan\n\nProfessional Services(Technical)\n\nAT&T - Mobility Solution Services\n\nPhone: 6093185979 x 4152003 |Email: db238w@att.com\n\nFrom: AirWatch Support [support@air-watch.com]\nSent: Friday, November 21, 2014 11:56 PM\nCc: Austin Perry; BHUYAN, DEEKSHITA; LONG, JASON W; Mark Kleine\nSubject: [AirWatch Support] Update: Windows Phone 8 Agent not sending data","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":326401451,"submitter_id":868396686,"assignee_id":713456528,"organization_id":20304476,"group_id":21992283,"collaborator_ids":[327754048,674430513,747990066,815684873,868396686,440301057],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_pt_gen","awid_pt_rsl","call_follow_up","customer","green","kb_ag","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","kb_pt","kb_pt_ms","kb_pt_pd","no_update_in_5_days","not_support","on_premise","partner","ptescalation","saas_dedicated","solved_ticket_macro","support__device_platforms__windows_phone__agent"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__windows_phone__agent"},{"id":20488011,"value":"5.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":""}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__windows_phone__agent"},{"id":20488011,"value":"5.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":""}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/468635.json","id":468635,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-11-24T17:24:00Z","updated_at":"2014-12-06T19:01:50Z","type":"incident","subject":"AT&T Escalation: Marriott CN35: New devices can't receive email -Powershell Allow commands not being sent for devices (Version 7.3.3.0)","raw_subject":"AT&T Escalation: Marriott CN35: New devices can't receive email -Powershell Allow commands not being sent for devices (Version 7.3.3.0)","description":"Hi Support,\n\nMarriott has opened multiple tickets with AT&T in regards to new device enrollments not receiving email.

This new iPhone 6+ \nruns IOS 8.1 though so that can’t be the problem, unless there is some kind of bug that prevents the IOS version \nto be read properly.\n\nI have un-enrolled and re-enrolled a test iPhone 5 with IOS 8.1, same procedure and no \nproblems there. \n\nI just asked the same user to enroll a test iPhone 5, same procedure and he could enroll. It seems to be an \nissue with the iPhone 6+, not the user. \n\nI tried to whitelist the iPhone 6+ based on the recorded UDID which was originally \n09080A84B6F21F5F60E820F5B202CD3726F0F695 (taken from device in “discovered” status). Then a second device \nappeared in the “discovered” status after the enrollment failed, again because it was not whitelisted. The \nstrange thing is that the UDID is different, it’s now 71CD8C243CDE37AD6E048B37D81548E92F35F466. \n\nSo in the Devices > List View, there are now two objects that represent the iPhone 6+: \n\niPhone7,1-09080a84b6f21f5f60e820f5b202cd3726f0f695 \niPhone7,1-71cd8c243cde37ad6e048b37d81548e92f35f466 \n\nThe second one also does not have a recorded serial number. Both are in “discovered” mode. \n\nI have deleted the discovered device from the console (multiple attempts), removing all traces from the device \n(both from Devices > List View \nand from Devices > Lifecycle) and trying to enroll from scratch (i.e., whitelisting the device again, then \ntrying to enroll) does not help.\n\nLastly, For the AMER OG, under Settings / Devices & Users / General / Enrollment, I already temporarily changed the \nDevices Enrollment Mode from “Registered Devices Only” to “Open Enrollment” but that didn’t help either. \n\nCan Airwatch confirm any issues with iPhone 6+ hardware?","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":822234116,"submitter_id":822234116,"assignee_id":611419478,"organization_id":20304476,"group_id":20823347,"collaborator_ids":[116298002],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_pt_gen","awid_pt_rsl","call_follow_up","green","kb_ag","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","kb_pt","kb_pt_ms","kb_pt_pd","partner","ptescalation","saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t","saas_dedicated","solved_ticket_macro","support__product_defect","support_console_settings_config"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_settings_config"},{"id":20488011,"value":"4"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"CMDM-182446"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_settings_config"},{"id":20488011,"value":"4"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"CMDM-182446"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/475997.json","id":475997,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-04T22:23:01Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T20:01:18Z","type":"question","subject":"AT&T- CN35 | Airwatch integration for SCCM","raw_subject":"AT&T- CN35 | Airwatch integration for SCCM","description":"In reference to #443524.

When doing a new app deployment, I found that the application actually deployed almost three hours after the effective date/time. This initial deployment was version 1.0.10.\n\nEffective date/time set: 12/12/2014 @ 2:00pm (eastern)\nActual time app deployed (per event logs): 12/12/2014 @ 4:43pm (eastern)\nThe first two screenshots in the attached .pdf are related to this first issue. The first screenshot is of my app effective date settings and the second screenshot shows event logs showing the delayed deployment.\n\nAdditionally, it seems that an updated version to an app never deploys if the effective date is set to a later date/time. I updated to 1.0.11 Set to auto push on 12/18 at 2:50pm. This app version never pushed. The third (last) screenshot in the attached .pdf shows that the new version is not assigned to any devices.\n\nAre these known issues with app deployment?\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information.\n\nThanks!\n\nDavid","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":614854363,"submitter_id":614854363,"assignee_id":668803763,"organization_id":20304476,"group_id":21992283,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_pt_gen","awid_pt_rsl","green","kb_ag","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","kb_pt","kb_pt_ms","kb_pt_pd","partner","saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t","saas_dedicated","support__console__application_management"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__application_management"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__application_management"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/475994.json","id":475994,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-04T22:18:49Z","updated_at":"2014-12-19T22:21:25Z","type":"incident","subject":"AT&T- CN35 |San Diego County | BB10 device getting wiped when setting up EAS","raw_subject":"AT&T- CN35 |San Diego County | BB10 device getting wiped when setting up EAS","description":"Hi,\n\nMy customer is having issue with BB10 device as when user enrolls his device and as soon as he sets his EAS mail manually the security wipe starts and device gets wiped.\nWant to know what could possibly cause this to happen as earlier the device was not getting wiped in Ver 7.2 and there's no policy on the exchange side which could cause this.\nCurrently CN35 is on Version 7.3\n\n\nRegards,\nMayank kheterpal","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":662846923,"submitter_id":662846923,"assignee_id":713456528,"organization_id":20304476,"group_id":21992283,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_pt_gen","awid_pt_rsl","green","kb_ag","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","kb_pt","kb_pt_ms","kb_pt_pd","partner","saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t","saas_dedicated","support__console__profile_management__eas_profile","support__product_defect"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"CMDM-181836"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn35___na___production___partner___at_t"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"CMDM-181836"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/484762.json","id":484762,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-18T21:03:15Z","updated_at":"2014-12-19T20:22:23Z","type":"incident","subject":"AT&T Inc. / AT&T Escalation: cn35: Zale Corp: Remote Control fails","raw_subject":"AT&T Inc. / AT&T Escalation: cn35: Zale Corp: Remote Control fails","description":"Account Type: Partner \nDescription: Hi support,\n\nZale is wanting to take advantage of Remote control on Samsung Safe devices, but it seems as if that features has a bug currently.
