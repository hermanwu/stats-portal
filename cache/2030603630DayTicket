Surprise.\n\nI need AirWatch to stop questioning my sanity, intelligence, and technical skills. As a SaaS company, please do your job to get to the bottom of why an email profile that I have deactivated comes activated again after x amount of time.\n\nWhy don’t you dig through your logs? No one hear touched my profiles. And other users have experienced the same issue.\n\nWe are going to migrate hundreds of mobile users to Exchange Online next year. How am I going to do that if this issue persists?\n\nThere is a problem. Please start from here. And not from maybe there isn’t a problem.\n\nDo not contact me to talk about this until you have something substantive to discuss.\n\n--\n\nAhmed\n\nFrom: AirWatch Support [mailto:support@air-watch.com]\nSent: Tuesday, October 21, 2014 6:29 AM\nTo: Akhtar, Ahmed\nSubject: [AirWatch Support] Request #444847: why did profile become active again?","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":204120622,"submitter_id":204120622,"assignee_id":708878547,"organization_id":20306036,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[112120923,700529358,136594622,712866033,710791807,499632118],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","enhanced","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__saas_dedicated","saas_dedicated","solved_ticket_macro","support__console__profile_management__eas_profile","support__customer_error","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/467190.json","id":467190,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"ahmed.akhtar@sephora.com","name":"Ahmed Akhtar"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-11-20T23:42:02Z","updated_at":"2014-11-26T19:01:11Z","type":"question","subject":"AirWatch Email Client","raw_subject":"AirWatch Email Client","description":"Desire:\n\nI want mobile devices that are not enrolled in AirWatch to not receive email.\n\nFor enrolled devices, I want to control whether or not they can save attachments locally.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat do I need?
