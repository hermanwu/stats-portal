Please look at the document here (http://www.entrust.net/knowledge-base/technote.cfm?tn=8863) for instructions. We’re interested in having the appropriate certificates installed to follow the second entry under Option 1 -\n\nEV Root ==> L1K Cross Certificate ==> L1K Chain ==> Public Certificate\n\nCan a change be scheduled import the two intermediate certificates (L1Kchain.txt, L1Kchainroot.txt)? More documentation on how to do this is here (http://www.entrust.net/knowledge-base/technote.cfm?tn=8848). Also, can you validate the chain using Entrust’s SSL Install Check tool here (http://sslinstallcheck.entrust.net/SIC/jsp/MainWebAddress.jsp) once the change has been completed? If the chain is set up correctly, then the Check tool should return the server certificate, two chain certificates, and the root certificate.

This has created a condition by which we had to increase the memory of our SEG servers back in November 15th from 8GB of RAM to 12 GB of RAM. The concern is that even after the increase in memory now we have a server that has 1GB of RAM available which for us it doesn’t make sense. We are wondering if something introduced in September or October might have created a memory leak condition where the server are now consuming almost all the available memory.\n\nSo you are aware the following has been changed to the environment since September (environment cn152):\n\n1. Sep 3rd, AirWatch Console CN152 and Secure Email Gateway Upgrade from 6.4 to 7.1 HF14\n\n2. Sep 17th, Launch of iOS8 (we only support iOS devices).\n\n3. Oct 20th, Launch of iOS8.1\n\n4. Nov 3rd, AirWatch Console CN152 Upgrade from version 7.1 HF14 to 7.2 FP6\n\n5. Nov 17th, Launch of iOS8.1.1\n\n6. Note: Every month we apply Windows Patches to the SEG servers.\n\nWe would like to work with you to identify the source of this large consumption of memory since there is a finite amount of memory we will be able to allocate to this already large machines.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nSergio Bascon\n\nSenior Messaging Engineer\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\n300 North LaSalle, Chicago, IL 60654\n\n+1 (312) 862-3060 direct\n\n+1 (312) 862-2000 main\n\n+1 (312) 862-2200 fax\n\nsergio.bascon@kirkland.com\n\nhttp://www.kirkland.com\n\n***********************************************************\nThe information contained in this communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may constitute inside information, and is intended only for the use of the addressee.
