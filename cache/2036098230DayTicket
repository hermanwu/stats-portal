Here¹s the steps that I¹ve used, first with the Altria client software load, then without.\nIn both cases, as ³Cold Boot² to the WinCE device adversely affects operation of the AirWatch Agent.\n\nTesting with Altria Software Loadset on MC9090CE device.\n\n1.  Factory Reset the MC9090CE device by loading BSP35 Firmware.\n2.  Establish Persistent WLAN Settings, that can withstand a ³Cold Boot² 3.  Load the Altria Client Software (without AppCenter for now), that consists of ESP Stay-Linked, Motorola DataWedge, SymScript, and various reg files, cpy files, and lnk files.\n4.  ³Cold Boot² the MC9090CE device to automatically install all software, apply registry settings, and establish baseline date and time (12/9/14\n10:00am)\n5.  Confirm correct software install and settings on MC9090CE device.\n6.  Perform the AirWatch Web Enrollment using the https://ds800.airwatchportals.com site.  The AirWatch 5.2.1.67 Agent is downloaded and installed.\n7   Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console  (Yes),\nconfirm that the AWCM Status is connected (Yes),  confirm that a message can be sent to the device (Yes), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (Yes) 8.  After Warm Boot, the device name changed in the console and no longer contains unique identifier information (UUID) 9.  Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console  (Yes), confirm that the AWCM Status is connected (Yes),  confirm that a message can be sent to the device (Yes), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (Yes) 10.  Install the AppCenter Admin Software by manually applying the AppCenter.reg file, and manually copying all of the necessary files to appropriate folders.  This step is normally done with step 3 above, but separated for this testing.\n11.  Confirm AppCenter installed correctly and is fully functional (Yes).\n12.  Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console (Yes), confirm that the AWCM Status is connected (Yes), confirm that a message can be sent to the device (Yes), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (Yes) 13.  Perform a manual ³Cold Boot² on the MC9090CE device.  This will re-install all necessary software components.  AppCenter will automatically start, as well as Stay-Linked, DataWedge, and SymScript.\n14.  Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console and that the device list view shows that the device can be seen (Yes), confirm that the AWCM Status is connected (Yes), confirm that a message can be sent to the device (NO), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (NO) 15.  Exit AppCenter on device to view AWCM status in AirWatch Diagnostics\nTool: AWCM Service NOT started\n16.  Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console and that the device list view shows that the device can be seen (Yes), confirm that the AWCM Status is connected (NO), confirm that a message can be sent to the device (NO), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (NO) 17.

Factory Reset the MC9090CE device by loading BSP35 Firmware.\n2. Remove the MC9090CE device from the AirWatch Console to start a new testing session.\n3.  Establish Persistent WLAN Settings, that can withstand a ³Cold Boot² 4. Establish current date and time settings.\n5.  Perform the AirWatch Web Enrollment using the https://ds800.airwatchportals.com site.  The AirWatch 5.2.1.67 Agent is downloaded and installed.\n6. Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console  (Yes), confirm that the AWCM Status is connected (Yes),  confirm that a message can be sent to the device (Yes), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (Yes) 7. The device name, in the console, does not contain unique identifier information (UUID) 8.  Confirm that the device appears in the AirWatch Console (Yes), confirm that the AWCM Status is connected (Yes), confirm that a message can be sent to the device (Yes), confirm that a warm boot command can be sent and is successful (Yes) 9.  Perform a manual ³Cold Boot² on the MC9090CE device.  This will re-install all necessary software components.
