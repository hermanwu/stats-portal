It’s now 10:15 on Tuesday and I’m running out of time to get this setup for our Office 365 Cutover.\n\nI believe I have the Directory Services integration setup, but I’m trying to find out if I can do the following:\n\n1) Only pull in AD accounts that have a UPN = @http://morehead.org (by default our AD accounts have a UPN of @http://mom.org, but any account that has a O365 mailbox, has had its UPN changed to @http://morehead.org, hence the reason we want these users imported into AirWatch) I know AirWatch can read the UPN value, as I saw it in the system.\n\n2) I’m wanting to try and setup the structure of the imported users to match our AD structure as per the following:\n\nMorehead Memorial Hospital (Top Level)\n\nMorehead AD Structure\n\nIS Dept\n\nEmergency Dept\n\nEngineering\n\nNursing\n\nEtc….\n\nBasic Accounts (manually entered)\n\nI want to set this up, so that we can put policies at the dept level if we want specific settings for certain departments, but we can still apply polices to the “Morehead AD Structure” level if we want them applied to all of the AD users.\n\nIf it can’t be done that’s fine, but I’m not really getting much assistance with this.\n\nChuck\n\nChuck Gilbert\n\nSystems Administrator\n\nMorehead Memorial Hospital\n\n336-627-6968 direct\n\n336.623.9711 ext.2849\n\n336-623-1059 (fax)","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":531178077,"submitter_id":375070573,"assignee_id":764354433,"organization_id":21609862,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn156___na___trial_production","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__enterprise_integration__authentication__user_groups","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn156___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__enterprise_integration__authentication__user_groups"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn156___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__enterprise_integration__authentication__user_groups"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/479789.json","id":479789,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-11T03:36:43Z","updated_at":"2014-12-24T19:01:21Z","type":"question","subject":"Setting up AirWatch Directory Integration (to Active Directory)","raw_subject":"Setting up AirWatch Directory Integration (to Active Directory)","description":"HOT ISSUE, doing Office 365 Rollout in less than a week.\n\nI'm setting up the Directory Services Integration, and I have a couple of questions.\n\n1) I'm wanting to see if I can permit only users who have a UPN = @morehead.org (by default all users on our AD Domain have their UPN = @mom.org.
