I was lead to believe that the issue that you guys are facing was a little bit different than the issue that they had. That is why I want to re-engage their team. I think that with the VPN testing that you have done, combined with the new release not resolving the issue, they need to look into the configuration logs again or maybe even just try to re-install the MAG with the configurations now that the Browser app has those MAG patches included in the software. I am thinking that might resolve the issue for you guys. We will get to the bottom of this for you guys and I want to ensure that is done in a timely manner. I'll keep you updated as I receive more information from them.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nKyle Anderson\n\nTerritory Account Executive - Northeast\n\nO | 470.247.6153\n\nC | 678.474.6438\n\nKyleAnderson@air-watch.com\n\nhttp://www.air-watch.com\n\nInteract with AirWatch via Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+\n\nThis communication is confidential and is intended to be privileged pursuant to applicable law.

Thank you for this information. I have resubmitted our ticket and am hoping to re-engage Catherine or someone on Catherine's team to have this looked at again for you guys. Since we have released the new Browser and the functionality has still not come back, I think they need to look at the configuration again with the new Browser.

I will stay close to this so that I can ensure we are getting the level of attention that we need with regards to this.

The client also conducted a trial with their VPN license where they were able to enable VPN on their iPad and try connecting to ‘Sterling Intranet’ (using Safari), and he has no issues, it means apparently there is no issue with iOS version of TLS version of the web application. We believe at this point that something is wrong with the MAG or the configuration of the MAG. Can we re-engage on this ticket for Waqas so that they can test this remaining piece of the solution? Any assistance or guidance that you could provide is greatly appreciated!\n\nKind Regards,\n\nKyle Anderson\n\nTerritory Account Executive - Northeast\n\nO | 470.247.6153\nC | 678.474.6438\nKyleAnderson@air-watch.com (mailto:kyleanderson@air-watch.com)\nwww.air-watch.com (http://www.air-watch.com/)\n\nInteract with AirWatch via Twitter (https://twitter.com/AirWatch), LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com/company/283586?trk=tyah) and Google+ (https://plus.google.com/u/0/106579500291096176030/posts)\n\nThis communication is confidential and is intended to be privileged pursuant to applicable law.
