(No issues getting push notification or emails btw, the app actually works well in general but it's annoying as fuck my friend )\n\nI'm running a Note4 in Canada on android 4.4.4\n\nUpon restarting the phone immediately there's a notification that airwatch requires my attention. However, the screen that is loaded shows two green check marks and all seems normal.\n\nThroughout the day Airwatch repeatedly loads the pop-up warning during other processes and interrupts everything else that's on the go.\n\nI'd say I get the pop-up about 50x a day. Mostly during loading of new pages within an already open app or switching to other apps or processes. \n\nI'm asking for a little help, at least tell me you're working on it and that an update is on it's way soon. \n\nHope this helps. \nThanks and good luck, looks like you need it.\n\nFelix \n\n\nSent from my Samsung device","priority":"low","status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":938401303,"submitter_id":938401303,"assignee_id":493636878,"organization_id":21747718,"group_id":20045507,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["email","n_a","not_support","support__customer_requests__end_user"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"n_a"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__customer_requests__end_user"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":""},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"n_a"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__customer_requests__end_user"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":""},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/484106.json","id":484106,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"aaronlafazan@gmail.com","name":"Aaron Lafazan"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-18T01:03:52Z","updated_at":"2014-12-23T17:02:13Z","type":"question","subject":"Wantrepreneurial Sponsorship","raw_subject":"Wantrepreneurial Sponsorship","description":"Hi.
