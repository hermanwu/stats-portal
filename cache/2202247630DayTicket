We were able to “checkout” the device to a user, but Airwatch is trying to push profiles based on the staging account instead of the current user who is logged in. How can I set this device to send profiles for each user that checks out the device? They rotate the iPad on a weekly basis.\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":727696817,"submitter_id":611419478,"assignee_id":929170173,"organization_id":22022476,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","solved_ticket_macro","support__implementation_error","support_console_profile_management_other"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_profile_management_other"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__implementation_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_profile_management_other"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__implementation_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":2}
