Now every time I do so even though i am not changing the App Restriction policy profile, I have to click \"Add Version\" then Publish, each and every time, and each time it adds a version number to it as well.\n\nIs this the correct process in which to do this, or am I doing more then I should for the effect that is needed?\n\nThanks,\nBrian Cinelli","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":287063063,"submitter_id":287063063,"assignee_id":705872933,"organization_id":22184611,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn118___na___production","solved_ticket_macro","support__feature_enhancement","support_application_management_public"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_public"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.0"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"PR-183939"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__feature_enhancement"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_public"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.0"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"PR-183939"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__feature_enhancement"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/471382.json","id":471382,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-11-26T20:15:38Z","updated_at":"2014-12-09T18:04:05Z","type":"question","subject":"Did Not Receive Email Notification of Outage","raw_subject":"Did Not Receive Email Notification of Outage","description":"Hi Brian,\n\nI'm creating this ticket to follow up on the issue of you not receiving an email about the outage yesterday.\n\nSincerely,\nAaron","priority":"normal","status":"open","recipient":null,"requester_id":287063063,"submitter_id":851262323,"assignee_id":493636878,"organization_id":22184611,"group_id":20045507,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","no_update_in_5_days","not_support","saas__cn118___na___production","support__triage_team_only__other","web_form"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__triage_team_only__other"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__triage_team_only__other"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/472215.json","id":472215,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-11-28T19:50:49Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T19:36:42Z","type":"incident","subject":"AirWatch Browser - Unable to retrieve browser settings from Server","raw_subject":"AirWatch Browser - Unable to retrieve browser settings from Server","description":"AirWatch,\n\nI have two users who are having an issue with the AirWatch Browser, when they try and log on to the AirWatch Browser they are unable to log in.  Their username and password is correct, but they receive an error message that states:\n\n\"Unable to Retrieve Browser settings from the server.\" - Screen Shot Provided.\n\nI troubleshot with the user by having them uninstall and re-install the app, from both methods our app catalog and from the google play store.  Both did not work.\n\nThere are a few topics on the AirWatch forums as well with no answers too.  Seems like this is not uncommon.\n\nThanks,\nBrian Cinelli","priority":"normal","status":"open","recipient":null,"requester_id":287063063,"submitter_id":287063063,"assignee_id":730735066,"organization_id":22184611,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["ae_escalation","api","awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","no_update_in_5_days","red","saas__cn118___na___production"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"red"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"red"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":4}
