When I open the Email dashboard in the console, it tells me I only have 2 devices enrolled in Email and one of them is out of compliance.  The one that is out of compliance is my personal Android device.  The reason it is blocked is because it is not encrypted, which is fine because the policy for personal devices does not yet mandate that setting.  The policy is being applied to my phone as though it is a company owned device even though it is not.  Furthermore, the other 2 Android devices don't even show up as enrolled in Email access but are yet somehow still able to get their email.","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":898279953,"submitter_id":898279953,"assignee_id":736148478,"organization_id":22189071,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","call_follow_up","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn274___na___trial_production","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__device_platforms__android__email_container"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__android__email_container"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.0"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__android__email_container"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.0"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/482165.json","id":482165,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-15T18:21:53Z","updated_at":"2014-12-21T01:01:42Z","type":"question","subject":"Smart Group Profile Assignment","raw_subject":"Smart Group Profile Assignment","description":"I have a smart group that I want to delete but it tells me there is still a profile assigned to it.
