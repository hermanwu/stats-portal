After an hour of troubleshooting, uninstalling/re-installing the apps and multiple reboots, we still could not resolve the issue. As a last resort, I had the user restore the iPhone to the factory settings. After the device was reset (not restored from a previous backup), I had her re-install the Agent. We went through the process and setup her corporate device, but now her inbox is empty and does not show any signs that it is even attempting to update. So, I had her enroll the corporate device as a personal device to verify it was not an issue with her group id, but she still does not have any corporate email in her inbox. I had her add a personal (Gmail) account to the device to verify it wasn't something corrupt with the mail clients on the device, but she's sending and receiving mail (Gmail account) just fine. Additionally, her corporate contacts were not uploading which may be related to her inbox not updating either. The strange part of this situation is her device shows up and connected and compliant in the Admin console, so I am at a loss as to what could be causing the issue. She has an relatively new iPhone 5S and only has the AirWatch application installed on the device (strictly corporate use). Has anyone had a similar issue before? I am wondering if it is the actual device that is faulty, but that is a long shot. I have been on the phone with her for a total of 2 1/2 hours split between two days and she is leaving on a business trip tomorrow (12.02.14) and must have access to her corporate email. This is a rather urgent matter, so please let me know what I need to provide so we can finally resolve this issue.\nThanks,\nJonathan Hoenshell\nIT Business Analyst\nProvidence Service Corporation\nDirect: 520-747-6678\nMobile: 520-308-8549","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":633338143,"submitter_id":633338143,"assignee_id":708878547,"organization_id":26272642,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[527157226,707153616],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","enhanced_support","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","partner:shadow-soft","solved_ticket_macro","support__console__profile_management__eas_profile","support__customer_error","top150"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/475817.json","id":475817,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-04T19:09:57Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T15:02:03Z","type":"question","subject":"Cannot access Admin web portal","raw_subject":"Cannot access Admin web portal","description":"My web browers won't connect to the admin web portal.
