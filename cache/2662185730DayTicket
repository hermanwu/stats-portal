For example, if I were to change the group that our iOS Native Email profile was assigned to, what effect would the end-users see? If the end-user device is also in the new group, would they see any changes? Or would the profile be reinstalled and thus cause them to re-enter their password? \n\nDoes changing the assignment for a profile/policy require the version to be incremented and thus require the profile/policy to be re-installed on end-user devices?\n\nthanks.","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":777914893,"submitter_id":777914893,"assignee_id":731712527,"organization_id":26621857,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn156___na___trial_production","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_grouping_organizational_groups","web_form"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn156___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_grouping_organizational_groups"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn156___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_grouping_organizational_groups"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/490744.json","id":490744,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-06T18:27:10Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T19:51:07Z","type":"incident","subject":"Please assist ASAP with getting AirWatch Inbox to work","raw_subject":"Please assist ASAP with getting AirWatch Inbox to work","description":"I have been trying for several weeks to get support with AirWatch Inbox.
