We have AirWatch connected to the VPP and successfully deployed an app with it.  Is there a trick to deploying books?\n\nHere are the steps we've taken so far:\n\n\n1.   Created a Smart Group for the iBook.\n\n2.   After the iBook shows up in our AirWatch Console in Apps & Books -> Books -> List View -> Purchased, I assign it to the appropriate Smart Group. In this instance, we purchased 42 licenses for the iBook. The smart group contains 42 members. I next entered 42 in the box for Allocated and clicked Save.\n\n3.   After assigning the app to the Smart Group, I exit the Edit Assignment screen, which takes me back to the list view of the iBooks we have purchased. On the far right hand side of the screen, I click the dropdown arrow and select notify devices - I notify the devices using email and push, as I don't think the majority of our students have their email associated with their AirWatch account.  The email/push then (is supposed to) notify the student that the iBook is available for download in the AirWatch AppCatalog.  It never shows up in the AppCat, and I don't believe the students are receiving the notification either.\n\n4.   I also go to the Smart Group and see that there is 1 Assignment available for 42 Devices.\n\n5.   Next, I click on the Edit button to view the members of the Smart group.  When I click Next, it shows a list of available Assignments for this Smart Group, in this instance, there is only 1.\n\n6.   Next I click the Publish button, and then it closes the Edit view of the Smart Group.\n\nThe iBook hasn't shown up for anyone so far.  I am wondering if it's possibly an issue with the AirWatch install on each Device. But, I did perform a fresh install of AirWatch on one Device that is in the Smart Group.  There wasn't a notification received via push or email, despite the fact that the users email is associated with the AirWatch group. Also, the iBook never shows up in her AppCat.\n\nWhat am I missing?  I think I have my bases covered as far as getting this deployed from the AirWatch console goes.\n\n\n-- \nRaymond Norton\nLCTN\n952.955.7766","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":385858871,"submitter_id":385858871,"assignee_id":720049436,"organization_id":26750628,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn157___na___trial_production___edu","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_application_management_books"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn157___na___trial_production___edu"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_books"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn157___na___trial_production___edu"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_books"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/474711.json","id":474711,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"mmorris@gsl.k12.mn.us","name":"Mike Morris"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-03T16:10:37Z","updated_at":"2014-12-10T22:03:06Z","type":"incident","subject":"Unable to sync in VPP Licenses","raw_subject":"Unable to sync in VPP Licenses","description":"?I am trying to sync lic and i get errors!!!

Below is their original \ndescription of the problem, including screen shots.\n\n\nOne further measure they took was to remove problem devices and members \nfrom the smart group and place back in again. However that did not \nresolve the issue.\n\nPlease advise on measures I can take to further trouble shoot this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nRay,\n\nFirst pic is of the Book Catalog which shows he title available for \ndownload. After hitting the Install button, it \"thinks\" for a couple of \nseconds before showing the screen that is the next pic. When clicking on \nAccept Invite, it thinks for maybe a half second - you see the progress \nbar fly across the screen - and then does nothing. The third screen \nshows the title available for download in the iBooks store. The status \nof the title - instead of the download cloud, price, or download sample \n- is View. When clicking on view, nothing happens. You can't even get in \nto see details about the book.\nThe students that have successfully downloaded the book had the \n\"download\" cloud icon in the iBook store.  The ones that haven't been \nsuccessful downloading the book get something similar to what I \ndescribed above, with different variations of what they can see in the \niBook store.\n\nSo far, I've tried deleting their device from AiWatch and \nreinstalling/readding the device. I tried with a freshly loaded iPad, \nwhich I updated to the latest iOS (it is the one you are looking at \nscreenshots from). I've tried republishing the book to the Smart Group. \nI have verified that the students are in the Smart Group Stalnaker \nEnglish 10. In the Apps and Books section, the title is listed and \nstates the group has 25 users, 24 licenses allocated, and 19 redeemed. \nAlso of note is that the profile for this user only has 5/6 Profiles \ninstalled - MACCRAYWOLVERINES-SCF isn't installed. There is an icon next \nto it indicating the install failed.  I've tried pushing the profile to \nthe device through the AirWatch console, but that hasn't work.  Also \nnote, that AirWatch was the first thing that was set up on this iPad. \nThe user's name is 17nicholas.pieper.\n\nAlso, for the students that were able to download the title, it took the \nwhole weekend - in some instances longer - for the title to be \ndownloadable.  We are well into three weeks of fighting this thing, and \nI would have to think that if it were just going to show up for \neverybody, it would have done so by now. We are experiencing nearly \nidentical issues with all of our iBooks purchases that are being \ndeployed through AirWatch.
