Awds.fdle.state.fl.us and seg.fdle.state.fl.us, there is no direct access to the mfmdm server externally. The internal server since it is a domain member would use *.myfdle.net or mfmdm.myfdle.net. The dns names are the same although the IP addresses are different for fdle.state.fl.us depending on where the requests originate ( internal or external ). We access the servers from the domain hosted dns through an internal IP, while everything external uses the external dms hosted dns entries and then the network team does their magic to get them to the dmz. These dns names are the same internally as externally just different routes based on where the requests originate.\n\n· Is your AWCM server in your DMZ? Are the DMZ and internal network on the same domain?\n\nYes it is in the dmz and no they are not, the servers in the DMZ are not domain members or members of any domain at all, awds.fdle.state.fl.us/seg.fdle.state.fl.us, while mfmdm the internal server is a domain member mfmdm.myfdle.net.\n\n· What is the domain to which the SSL certificate on the AWCM server is bound?\n\nAWCM is installed on awds with the *.fdle.state.fl.us certificate bound in iis. I am not sure if AWCM is using a airwatch generated cert or not Jorge should be able to look at that in the application\n\nJorge Fonte (Systems Programmer III)\n\nFlorida Dept. of Law Enforcement\n\n786-336-1057 (Office)\n\n786-367-5448 (Cell)","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":389274861,"submitter_id":389274861,"assignee_id":397812202,"organization_id":27287767,"group_id":20823347,"collaborator_ids":[264909876,736148478],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","identified_tfs","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","no_update_in_5_days","not_support","on_premise","ptescalation","solved_ticket_macro","support","support_android_platform_specific_samsung","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"support"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_android_platform_specific_samsung"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"support"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_android_platform_specific_samsung"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":2}
