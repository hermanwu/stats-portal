I even tried syncing the device through the admin console, still no changes.\n\nUnder the \"apps\" tab on the admin console, it lists this application as installed (but grayed out), I am ensure you it wasn't manually installed by accessing the application store.\n\nTouch base with me at 416-918-3025 when you want do the troubleshooting.\n\nThanks.","priority":"normal","status":"open","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":777366803,"submitter_id":777366803,"assignee_id":886210443,"organization_id":34839043,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn239___can___trial_production","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_application_management_vpp","web_form","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn239___can___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_vpp"},{"id":20488011,"value":"5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn239___can___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_vpp"},{"id":20488011,"value":"5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":5}
