I have followed Pages 98-100 in the “IOS Platform Guide, version v.2014.11” but still cannot get it working.\n\nI have the trial version of Reflector installed on my laptop.  My laptop is set up as a Destination.  When I click on Remote View in the Web Portal I see a “Accept Remote View Request” appear on the device.  When I click on it I get and AirPlay window asking “Would you like to display your iPad’s screen on AirWatch Support?”  When I choose Display I see a Volume icon then it disappears.  I never see the devices display on my laptop.\n\nWe’ve tried this between 2 iPads with the same results.\n\nHow can I set up remote sessions with iPads and Android tablets so I can see their screens for support calls?\n\nThanks,\nMichael Olshefski\nNetwork Administrator\nJ.
