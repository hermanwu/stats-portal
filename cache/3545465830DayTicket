Removing a device/smart group from an app's assignment is not resulting in the app being removed from the device\n - While on call, we noted that for a couple of devices, the apps (Edmodo and History Line) were not managed by AirWatch since they had been installed via Automatic Downloads (a sync for the Apple account initiated by Apple).\n - For all 6 devices in the Airwatch Test 2 smart group, I was able to confirm that the licenses for these 2 apps had been revoked and the remove application command was generated.\n - Since the apps were installed via Automatic Downloads, AirWatch does not manage them and hence cannot remove the application from the device\n - We Assigned Adobe Voice to these devices (focusing on devices with usernames acoy2 and ablank). Once the app has been confirmed as installed on these devices, go ahead and revoke the assignment and check if the application is removed\n\n2. The app installation status is not being updated on the console (Device Details> Apps)\n - We queried the device but never received the device list sample (Security Information)\n - Since we are experiencing significant latency with your environment, I would advise that we wait until the server issues are resolved before testing this further\n\n3. Guidelines for best practices when using VPP with DEP devices: https://resources.air-watch.com/save/ww65mrm99fbff9wby6fs/en\n - Specifically, I would recommend using a unique apple ID per device and ensuring that Automatic Downloads for apps be switched off an every device.\n\nPlease leave an update on this ticket when you are available to look in to this further or if you have any questions and we will be glad to reach out.\n\nTruly,\nAirWatch Support","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":887787263,"submitter_id":695571657,"assignee_id":728280163,"organization_id":35454658,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[695571657],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["customer","green","saas__cn157___na___trial_production___edu","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_application_management_vpp","web_form"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn157___na___trial_production___edu"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_vpp"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn157___na___trial_production___edu"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_vpp"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/476270.json","id":476270,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"cmmanson@alleganps.org","name":"Cheryl-Marie Manson"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-05T13:49:02Z","updated_at":"2014-12-19T21:43:36Z","type":"question","subject":"Installing Updates for Java to our Netbooks using AirWatch","raw_subject":"Installing Updates for Java to our Netbooks using AirWatch","description":"We would like to find a solution to update Java on our Netbooks using AirWatch.
