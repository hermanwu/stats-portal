I'd like to be able to set a home page URL in the AirWatch Browser application that is different from the home page URL that is configured for all of my other users.  I see that I can change the global home page URL for all users in the Groups & Settings > All Settings > Apps > Browser menu.  How would I configure a different home page URL for a single user or a single device?  If that is not possible, could I create a new group which had a different home page URL?  How would I do that?  Thanks.","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":819116456,"submitter_id":819116456,"assignee_id":731712527,"organization_id":35588483,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","green","kb_frf","saas__cn274___na___trial_production","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_console_settings_config"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_settings_config"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_settings_config"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":2}
