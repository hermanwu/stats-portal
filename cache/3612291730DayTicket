We are still touching every single iPad to download apps from the app store. This is not acceptable, as we were under the impression that we could have teachers download apps from the catalog, and keep the students and teachers out of the app store.\n\nWe have hit nothing but road blocks with this service, and still now 6 months later still do not have a functioning product. Please advice, as we are considering going to a different product.\n\n Erin Van Guilder\n\nFrom: AirWatch Support <support@air-watch.com<mailto:support@air-watch.com>>\nReply-To: AirWatch Support
