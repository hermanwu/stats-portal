The console brought up the CAPTCHA prompt the FIRST time I tried to log in this morning. It took EIGHT tries to log in! I typed the CAPTCHA and my password correctly! This is getting ridiculous and extremely frustrating. What good is your product if I cannot stay logged in to monitor my devices? I spend more time trying to get past being blocked by the password prompt than I do using the console! Is there anything that can be done to correct these issues aside from switching MDM solutions? I would have thought that being one of the top MDM solutions, these elementary issues would be non-existent.\n\nThank you,\n\nConrad Bacon\n\nPCS Company\n\n586-541-2014\n\nx1514","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":793526963,"submitter_id":793526963,"assignee_id":758706756,"organization_id":39462903,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[783574883,700529358],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","identified_tfs","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_ft","kb_pa","na","saas__cn274___na___trial_production","saas_cn274_trial_production_north_america","solved_ticket_macro","support__console__admin_login","support__usability","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__admin_login"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"CMDM-179959"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__usability"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__admin_login"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"CMDM-179959"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__usability"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/481813.json","id":481813,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"cbacon@pcs-company.com","name":"Conrad Bacon"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-15T13:46:47Z","updated_at":"2014-12-19T13:44:52Z","type":"incident","subject":"ISSUES","raw_subject":"ISSUES","description":"ISSUE #1:\n\nI have been back and forth with support concerning being unable to log in. I am enclosing several screenshots of my attempts. I am going to include a description corresponding to the number labeled on the screenshot. I have cleared my cache, deleted my cookies, and used THREE different browsers. I have checked the box to “remember my password”, and the auto log in always fails. I have logged in manually and it fails at least 50% of the time. I am aware that the logs show “incorrect password” or however it is phrased. That is more likely failed CAPTCHA attempts because I KNOW my password. And I can type.\n\nScreenshot number:\n\n1) It took me approximately 8 tries to log in when typing my password CORRECTLY. This is a combination of being blocked and failed CAPTCHA attempts.\n\n2) Sometimes when it finally does log me in, I get this screen. A blank screen showing “2014” in the corner isn’t very helpful.\n\n3) And on top of all of this frustration, I go to log on this morning and I have to change my password YET AGAIN when I usually can’t log on in the first place.\n\nTo add to all this frustration, the console will timeout and log me off seemingly every 45 minutes! What good is monitoring/managing software if it won’t stay up so that you can MONITOR your devices? From what I was told there is no way for me to change the timeout in any of the settings. That is RIDICULOUS. We are paying good money for this service, yet have no control over basic functions such as console uptime. I have used several other applications that allow you to SET the timeout. (GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, etc.)\n\nI was contacted by your support member about these issues. He wanted to have a WebEx meeting. I have described in DETAIL what the issues are. I have assured him that I CAN type and that I KNOW my password. I instructed him that it would be a waste of both our time to have a WebEx meeting. What would be the point? So that he could watch me type in my password? I am the only IT person in charge of 100 users. My time is extremely limited. I told him that it would be a waste of time and unless he actually had a SOLUTION to these issue, that I do not have the time for a useless WebEx meeting. His response was that he was going to close the ticket and for me to try “deleting my cookies”. Really? I have done all those things and more. Which is why I declined the WebEx meeting-I do not have time to sit while someone watches me clear my cache, type my password, delete my cookies, switch web browsers etc. I HAVE ALREADY TRIED ALL OF THOSE THINGS.\n\nISSUE #2:\n\nI also brought this issue up without even receiving a response. Being a novice with the AirWatch service, I try to go through the videos when I have time so that I can become familiar with the service. That is another issue in itself. The narrator will flip to a screen describing what he is talking about and it is too small to see. If you expand it so that you can see it, it becomes illegible. I am enclosing screenshots “a and b” to verify. How am I supposed to learn your product when I cannot even read what he is trying to demonstrate in the videos?\n\nAt the present time I am finding the AirWatch product to be basically useless. It takes me several tries to log in, once logged in I get booted out 15 times a day. Which takes me back to square one with not being able to log in again. On top of that, having to change my password that doesn’t work every six weeks is beyond annoying. And when I try to learn your product I get road blocked with ineligible screens so I am completely lost and cannot understand half the things he is demonstrating.\n\nI would really appreciate a SOLUTION to these issues not another recommendation to clear my cache, delete my cookies or switch my browsers. I am extremely frustrated and so far find your product USELESS for my company. What would I like to see?\n\n1) I would like to be able to log in the first time I type my password\n\n2) I would like to be able to set the timeout so that I am not kicked out 15 times a day forcing me to go through the whole “wrong password” nonsense again\n\n3) I would like to be able to actually READ the information in the videos\n\nAll of these things are quite elementary and I would imagine should be an afterthought but unfortunately they are keeping me from being able to use your product. I have brought these issues to the attention of the IT Manager and he is also less than pleased. I would appreciate a solution or at least something more than being told yet again to “clear my cache”.\n\nThank you,\n\nConrad Bacon\n\nPCS Company\n\n(586) 541-2014 x1514","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":793526963,"submitter_id":793526963,"assignee_id":598077373,"organization_id":39462903,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[783574883],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_ft","kb_pa","na","saas__cn274___na___trial_production","saas_cn274_trial_production_north_america","support__console__admin_login","support__customer_error"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__admin_login"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__admin_login"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":2}
