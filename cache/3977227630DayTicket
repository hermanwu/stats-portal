I understand that you have virtually no control over this but please consider what I have written as a serious road block and one that could be a threat to our company's proprietary data. \n\nHi,\nI work for a company that is preparing to deploy new mobile devices to our users. My company owns the device and as such, we NEED to limit certain functions/services that the iPhone currently uses. This is an EXTREME point of frustration as I really hope Apple understands what they are doing by forcing the use of personal Apple ID's on business customers. This is NOT business friendly and is very counter productive to my company's specific environment needs. We have proprietary data that needs to be protected so this is the tipping point and is extremely important to us. We also currently use Airwatch which is LIMITED as to what it can do because of your restrictions which is also very frustrating. \n\nWhat I need to do is setup a device that has exchange connectivity which we have, we also need to block access to certain functions like Accounts and such but unfortunately, this isn't possible without the use of Apple configurator. I could turn on restrictions but then central management is useless. Pushing apps is also a nightmare because each device needs to be signed in to an Apple ID before it can even download an app. On top of that, I NEED to attach a credit card to each Apple ID I create even if the business user has no interest or need in having the Apple ID in the first place. \n\nIf I could create an Apple ID without a credit card that would relieve a little bit of frustration but I'm still tethered to what I believe is a more difficult, convoluted way to push Apple policies and apps to my businesses devices. \n\nI have read about the work around to download free apps w/o a credit card but how long is that even going to work and I'm not so sure it's the correct path to go down since it appears as a hacked way to get apps. \n\nPLEASE help me with my frustrations and understand that I'm a business user that has DIFFERENT needs than your typical consumer. \n\nI personally use Apple devices iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro and I do enjoy the use of iCloud but your policies are trying to shove a consumer service into a business environment when it's clearly not needed and creates far more headache. \n\nPlease listen to what I'm saying and understand that I'm just one of MANY that is facing frustration with your MDM approach. \n\nI appreciate your time.\n\nBest Regards, \nJames Smith","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":907818416,"submitter_id":907818416,"assignee_id":723799488,"organization_id":39772276,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","na","on_premise","red","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__device_platforms__ios"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__ios"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"red"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__ios"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"red"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/464725.json","id":464725,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"to":{},"from":{"ticket_id":null,"subject":null},"rel":"follow_up"}},"created_at":"2014-11-18T15:10:02Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T20:02:57Z","type":"question","subject":"RE: [AirWatch Support] Request #455091: Restricting the addition of Google email accounts on Samsung Galaxy S4","raw_subject":"RE: [AirWatch Support] Request #455091: Restricting the addition of Google email accounts on Samsung Galaxy S4","description":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #455091 \"Restricting the addition of...\"\n\nHi Monalisa,\n\nI apologize I haven’t gotten back to you as it’s been quite a busy two weeks.
