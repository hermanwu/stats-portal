I was looking at the ActiveSync profile and don’t see an option to set the default calendar, but the option is available on iOS devices. We’re running AirWatch 7.2.6.0 in an on premise environment. I’m aware that Apple made a lot of changes with ActiveSync and was wondering if in 7.3 (or later) we have the ability to set the default calendar to the ActiveSync calendar for iOS devices.\n\nMark Felty\n\nMobile Device Management Advisor – Tenet Health\n\nDell | Infrastructure Security Support\n\noffice +1 972-577-7477\n\nemail mark_felty@dell.com","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":374339706,"submitter_id":374339706,"assignee_id":731711237,"organization_id":20309161,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","email","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","partner","solved_ticket_macro","support__console__profile_management__eas_profile","support__usability"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__usability"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__usability"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/490602.json","id":490602,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-06T16:20:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T13:15:11Z","type":"question","subject":"Batch Import With Token","raw_subject":"Batch Import With Token","description":"We would like to start using the batch import feature, however, we use token enrollment.
