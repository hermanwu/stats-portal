When he couldn’t find it, he thought it was weird because he was fairly sure the user was a member of the correct group. Eric double checked, and found that as system admin you could see the user. It’s a relatively minor issue as we obviously hadn’t noticed it prior to today. It’s just something that doesn’t make sense to us based on the way we set up the org groups and roles.\n\nShane A Lingo\n\nSecurity Engineer | Desktop Security Tools\n\nNational Governance Risk & Compliance (NGRC) | Information and Infrastructure Security (IIS)\n\nPhone: 610.732.2471\n\nCell: 267.226.7116\n\n1354 Boot Road West Chester, PA, 19382\n\nEmail: Shane_Lingo@cable.comcast.com (mailto:Shane_Lingo@cable.comcast.com)\n\nSecurity Response Center: 877.249.7306\n\nFrom: AddisonThomas@air-watch.com [mailto:AddisonThomas@air-watch.com]\nSent: Monday, January 05, 2015 12:00 PM\nTo: Lingo, Shane (West Chester)\nSubject: RE: Mobility Administrator Role\n\nWhat exactly are you trying to do when you notice this issue?

Basically, we’re seeing some oddities in the admin user list depending on the role of the person viewing it.\n\nWhen a user is on as system admin at the Comcast level org group, they see all of the users in that list. However, when they change roles, to mobility administrator or security admin roles at the Comcast level, the list changes who it displays. For example, as mobile admin role @ Comcast, I can see all of the ‘level 2’ role users set at the divisional levels below Comcast. But I can’t see the ‘level 3’ role users set on those same levels. As a ‘level 3’ @ Comcast, I can only see other ‘level 3’ users, but not the ‘level 2’ ones set at the same level.\n\nI took screen shot of the role filter displayed to the mobility admin\n\nBut this is the same filter given to system admin at the same org level\n\nI’m not sure what the issue is. These users have access to read the admin user list. My thinking is that if I have that access and a role assigned at Comcast, I should be able to see all users assigned at that level or below. I don’t see anything obvious in the role permissions that leads me to think it’s something there, though I’m still looking there.\n\nAny suggestions on where to start to tackle this?\n\nThanks,\n\nShane A Lingo\n\nSecurity Engineer | Desktop Security Tools\n\nNational Governance Risk & Compliance (NGRC) | Information and Infrastructure Security (IIS)\n\nPhone: 610.732.2471\n\nCell: 267.226.7116\n\n1354 Boot Road West Chester, PA, 19382\n\nEmail: Shane_Lingo@cable.comcast.com (mailto:Shane_Lingo@cable.comcast.com)\n\nSecurity Response Center: 877.249.7306\n\nFrom: Dorsam, Anthony\nSent: Monday, January 05, 2015 11:21 AM\nTo: Lingo, Shane (West Chester)\nCc: [CDC - Mobility Services]\nSubject: Mobility Administrator Role\n\nHi Shane, Happy New Year!\n\nI was trying to locate a level 3 administrator in the AirWatch console and although I can see the user in the Admin 3 group, I cannot do an individual search in the list view of the administrators page.
