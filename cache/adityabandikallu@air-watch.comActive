We have -- for many, many months -- seen the problem where not all devices receive/update the apps automatically. We have discussed this with AirWatch before without a satisfactory resolution.\n\nI’d like you to reproduce this problem before asking more questions. According to QA, this issue should be reproducible in a sample test of several devices. The issue occurs when the device is enrolled into the destination group or moved from the source group into the destination group. I have listed two groups as examples below; the problem is not restricted to just these groups.\n\nDestination group:\n\nGroup ID = apple-pay-pilot2\n\nUsername = retail2\n\nPassword = R3tail2013\n\nSource group:\n\nDestination group:\n\nGroup ID = mpos-pacific\n\nUsername = retail2\n\nPassword = R3tail2013\n\nPlease try to have the test completed before noon tomorrow Pacific time.
