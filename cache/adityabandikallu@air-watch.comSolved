I noticed that the redemption codes that have already been used needed to be deactivated from the console, so they won’t be a part of the “pool” of redemption codes that are issued to users who are in the smart group we created. What I have noticed though is that once a user is issued a redemption code they get the first ones available, but if I deactivate and reactivate that same code it’s able to be used again, even if the user still has the app on their device.\n\nAre the redemption codes in the pool of redemption codes being acknowledged by the app store as being used once the app is pushed to the device? I understand if a user takes a redemption code to the app store and manually enters that code, that user’s apple id is associated with that code and we can’t use it even if that code is active, however, I’m not sure how it works when the app is being pushed to the device, using a redemption code.\n\nAny assistance on this issue will be most appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nEarl Sisco\nFederal Aviation Administration,\nInfrastructure and Operations Service\nOperations Services Division\n\nInfrastructure Applications Branch\n\nOffice: 404-474-5037\nCell: 404-719-3891\n\n\"Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.\" - Leo Tolstoy","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":351948077,"submitter_id":351948077,"assignee_id":695571657,"organization_id":20258843,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_application_management_vpp"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_vpp"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_application_management_vpp"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/490542.json","id":490542,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-06T15:26:51Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T21:20:02Z","type":"incident","subject":"allowing users access to VPP apps","raw_subject":"allowing users access to VPP apps","description":"In our airwatch environment, i am not able to browse the VPP purchased apps when I am anywhere in the folder hierarchy except the very top level (Bonita Unified School District) .
