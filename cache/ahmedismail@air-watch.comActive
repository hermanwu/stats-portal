They have paid for (1) 2 day health checks. They would like to schedule this as soon as as possible given the teams availability.\n\nSF Opp Closed -  (An order with 1 Health Checks - T&E ADDITIONAL is attached to this Opp): https://na3.salesforce.com/0065000000TEaYZ\n\nNotes: 9,000 iOS devices, STRATEGIC ACCOUNT as this is the largest 1:1 iPad deployment in Alabama (FTE deal, On-Premise)\n\nSEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS FOR DETAILS:  I’ve attached a document detailing previous issues that they would also like to be addressed in the Health Check. Please note the previous help desk tickets (open and recently closed as they’ve been ongoing issues). Overall goal – they’ve been frustrated with their AirWatch deployment and have thought about trial-ing competitors. After speaking with AirWatch customer McAllen ISD, they decided the best route to get their environment and deployment back on track was to assess their concerns via onsite health check and from this create a custom SOW (I can work with your team on this) reviewing their DBA (not to make changes). For reference, this DBA assessment was previously done with McAllen. Please let me know if you have any other questions, my contact information is below.\n\nDeployment Type: Perpetual, EDU - On–Premise\n\nPoint of Contact:\n\n1) Mark Williams -  (334) 793-1397 / mwilliams@dothan.k12.al.us<mailto:mwilliams@dothan.k12.al.us>\n\n\nThanks,\n\nLauren Krupp\nEDU Sales – GA, AL & TN\nO | 470.247.6271\nC | 770.846.7589\nlaurenkrupp@air-watch.com\nwww.air-watch.com<http://www.air-watch.com/>\nInteract with AirWatch via Twitter<https://twitter.com/AirWatch>, LinkedIn<http://www.linkedin.com/company/283586?trk=tyah> and Google+<https://plus.google.com/u/0/106579500291096176030/posts>\n[Description: AirWatch - We Simplify Enterprise Mobility]<http://www.air-watch.com/>\nThis communication is confidential and is intended to be privileged pursuant to applicable law.
