Seemingly all of these users have at least one device enrolled under one of the two accounts. \n\nThe reason there are duplicate users is because these users were once pulled into AirWatch from your AD (possibly using Bulk Import) and then had device enrolled under them. These users were later removed from your AD, however the user accounts stayed within AirWatch due to having devices enrolled. \n\nWhen these users were re-created in your AD, they had different distinguished names (and objectGUID identifiers) and so they were synced into the console once Directory Services was set up to sync in. If the users that were synced in (which currently do not have devices enrolled) are deleted, they return to the console on the next AD sync. \n\nThe current workaround is to un-enroll the devices from the user that is no longer in AD, delete the user, and re-enroll the device under the correct user that is existent in AD. Since there are about ~1600 devices with this scenario, it will be difficult to do so manually. \n\nTherefore, I will ask our database team to see if we can correctly identify the users in the database that are duplicates and have devices enrolled to therefore have those devices be associated with the correct user, and later delete the original users.\n\nRegards,\n\nAhmed","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":949969716,"submitter_id":720049436,"assignee_id":720049436,"organization_id":22178861,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[376587363,380317887],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["customer","green","on_premise","support__customer_error","support__infrastructure__directory_services","web_form"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__infrastructure__directory_services"},{"id":20488011,"value":"2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__infrastructure__directory_services"},{"id":20488011,"value":"2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/491294.json","id":491294,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-07T13:45:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T13:41:40Z","type":"question","subject":"Dothan City Schools, AL  / VPP Applications not syncing / New enrollment not receiving Apps","raw_subject":"Dothan City Schools, AL  / VPP Applications not syncing / New enrollment not receiving Apps","description":"Hunter, \n\nI've created this ticket so we can track the issue of your VPP applications not appearing in the Purchased tab of your newly enrolled devices.

The following conditions must be met in order for a device to check in location data.\n\n- For WiFi only devices, location data is reported when the device is on, unlocked, and the agent is open. \n- For Cellular devices, GPS data will be reported when the device changes cell towers.\n- We also have applications such as AirWatch Browser and Secure Content Locker that will report GPS data when the end-user opens and uses them\n- Location services settings should be enabled from console and on the device. \n- The AirWatch Agent application must be running in the background on the device, but preferably in the foreground.\n- The device must be unlocked at the time of the change in location.\n\nIn summary, it is ultimately up to the iOS operating system to allow applications to refresh and run in the background in order for the Agent to collect location data.\n\n>To save battery, apps running in the background refresh at certain times, like when your device is connected to Wi-Fi, plugged into a power source, or being actively used. (From Apple Support: [Understand multitasking and background activity](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4211))\n\n>If your app is terminated either by a user or by the system, the system doesn’t automatically restart your app when new location updates arrive.
