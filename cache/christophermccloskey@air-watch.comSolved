We have configured the Custom Email profile to use Mail Client: AirWatch Inbox and have the profile configured as seen in attached screenshot. We have a payload certificate uploaded and it is the same certificate that our EAS profile for the Native Mail Client uses. Enrollment into the BYOD group is working and it seems that directory services is functioning fine as when enrolling I am using the same credentials that I would use to access AirWatch Inbox. I am able to launch AirWatch Inbox and it will pull in my username but it never allows me to type in my password. It automatically tries to authenticate with no password over and over locking my account continuously. Only way to stop the process is to kill the app.","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":701696778,"submitter_id":701696778,"assignee_id":588579967,"organization_id":20263798,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","solved_ticket_macro","support__device_platforms__ios__inbox","support__feature_enhancement"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__ios__inbox"},{"id":20488011,"value":".5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"AEC-180732"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__feature_enhancement"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__ios__inbox"},{"id":20488011,"value":".5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"AEC-180732"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__feature_enhancement"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/488482.json","id":488482,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2014-12-31T14:31:18Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T19:24:47Z","type":"question","subject":"AAA South Jersey / Inbox not configured on Shared Device","raw_subject":"AAA South Jersey / Inbox not configured on Shared Device","description":"Hi Jesse,\n\nAs mentioned over the other ticket, I have created this new ticket to help troubleshoot the issues you are having where Inbox is saying it is not configured once the device is checked out.\n\nPlease let me know when you are available for a call to do some testing.\n\nThanks,\nChris","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":374804566,"submitter_id":588579967,"assignee_id":588579967,"organization_id":26672423,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn118___na___production","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__device_platforms__android__inbox","web_form"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__android__inbox"},{"id":20488011,"value":".25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__android__inbox"},{"id":20488011,"value":".25"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/488988.json","id":488988,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"simpsond@mmc.org","name":"Dwayne Simpson"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-02T18:34:13Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T19:23:01Z","type":"question","subject":"Email via SEG for Mac OS X devices","raw_subject":"Email via SEG for Mac OS X devices","description":"Good afternoon.\n\nI'm trying to get email working for a MacBook pro running OS 10.9.5 via the SEG and it's not working.
