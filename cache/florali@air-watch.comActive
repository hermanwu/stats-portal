All three users are experiencing the same prompt for domain credentials several times a day when opening AirWatch Inbox. In every instance, the AirWatch Inbox prompts for a new passcode to be created even though it was previously configured. In addition, Inbox sync with Exchange occurs again even though it was previously completed. In order for us to consider this to be a viable solution we need to address this issue of reconfiguring the AirWatch Inbox multiple times a day. This would not be the best end user experience.","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":378858612,"submitter_id":378858612,"assignee_id":730172913,"organization_id":24154326,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn118___na___production","support__customer_error","support__device_platforms__ios__inbox"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__ios__inbox"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn118___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__ios__inbox"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/492380.json","id":492380,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-08T16:35:37Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T17:20:54Z","type":"question","subject":"Walgreens Co./Questions in regards to Certs","raw_subject":"Walgreens Co./Questions in regards to Certs","description":"Customer Name: Suresh Sankar\nCompany Name: Walgreens Co.\nTelephone Number: 91-9994063108 \n(Alternate: (224)-475-3893) -  Jeino\nEmail Address: suresh.sankar@walgreens.com\nEnvironment: On-premise\n\nCustomer Issue: Admin has a few questions around certificates in AirWatch - \n\n1) Certificate-based enrollment for Android devices.
