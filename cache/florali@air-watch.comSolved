Aside from device sample (application list, device profile, etc), Airwatch agent will also send a beacon to console including telecom, location or compromised status information. If we do not receive beacon from Airwatch agent from device, console will show as \"pending compliance checking\". \n\nPossibly some of the end user does not have airwatch agent running in the background, therefore airwatch agent would not be able to send beacon to console. What we can do from an end-user stand point:\n\n- we can ask them update their Airwatch agent or send data from airwatch agent. \n- If the agent is not up-to-date, please also update the agent from device. \n- Make sure airwatch agent is running in the background (do not remove airwatch agent from device);\n- they can also try to close the agent and re-open the agent.\n\nSome steps we can do from console\n\n- try to change organization group on the console\n - click on one device and this will navigate to device detail view >more (top right) > change organization group > you do not need to change any thing, just click on \"save\" on that page\n- try to save edit device page\n - click on one device and this will navigate to device detail view >more (top right) > edit device > you do not need to change any thing, just click on \"save\" on that page\n- create a new dummy compliance policy and this compliance policy will run and for device report back to the console again.\n - compliance policy > add a telecom compliance policy > do not specify any \"actions\" and assign to all devices so that we would include these devices that are pending compliance checking. \n\nThis three options will force console to run a sproc to collect some device level information. If this is an urgent issue for you and wants to fix it immediately, we can go ahead and force sproc to run by complete the three steps from console. If this is not an urgent one, we can wait for 1-2 weeks to let the compliance checking runs and let end users try to send data from their devices. \n\nPlease let me know if that works for you, thanks.\n\nRegards,\nFlora","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":332250606,"submitter_id":730172913,"assignee_id":730172913,"organization_id":26886538,"group_id":21860503,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","enterprise_support","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__saas_dedicated","saas_dedicated","support","support__customer_error","support_console_compliance"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"support"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_compliance"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"support"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_compliance"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"brand_id":2336986,"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":1}
