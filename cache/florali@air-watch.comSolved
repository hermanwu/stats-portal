As I understand things, installing a downloaded ROM from a website, as opposed to updating it via the System Update feature of the phone, would indicate a rooted phone. Un-rooting is a difficult proposition. I have heard that if the original was backed up, there might be a way to restore it to its original un-rooted state, but haven’t heard of anyone actually successfully accomplishing this.\n\nAndy Kahl\n\nDesign & Implementation Engineer III\n\nCDK Global, LLC\n\nInternal IT Support\nMichigan-Home Office\nOffice: 224.520.6691\nMobile: 248.259.8994\ncdkglobal.com\n\nFormerly ADP Dealer Services\n\nFrom: Vanamali, Sreeharsha (DS)\nSent: Thursday, December 11, 2014 9:50 AM\nTo: Kahl, Andy; Madhav, Sai (DS)\nSubject: RE: Non-Compliance - Can we do something to fix this?\n\nThanks for the response and this is what it is.\n\nI had a problem with my phone once and after researching the issue, the supported advised me to install the latest ROM from the website.

I am not sure if that is being considered as rooting and the reason for non-compliance.\n\nThank you,\n\n- Harsha\n\nFrom: Kahl, Andy\nSent: Thursday, December 11, 2014 7:06 PM\nTo: Madhav, Sai (DS)\nCc: Vanamali, Sreeharsha (DS)\nSubject: RE: Non-Compliance - Can we do something to fix this?\n\nThe compromised status of true generally indicates either the device has been rooted or has an app installed that would typically only be found on a rooted device. Unfortunately, AirWatch doesn’t give us much in the way of insight into exactly why a particular device is flagged as compromised.\n\nIf the device has ever been rooted, there’s a good chance it won’t work as it is rare that once rooted, a device can be completely ‘un-rooted’.\n\nIf you are sure the device has never been rooted and has the factory original OS still, then we’ll need a list of all of the apps installed to send to AirWatch for review of which might be triggering the status.\n\nAndy Kahl\n\nDesign & Implementation Engineer III\n\nCDK Global, LLC\n\nInternal IT Support\nMichigan-Home Office\nOffice: 224.520.6691\nMobile: 248.259.8994\ncdkglobal.com\n\nFormerly ADP Dealer Services\n\nFrom: Madhav, Sai (DS)\nSent: Thursday, December 11, 2014 6:09 AM\nTo: Kahl, Andy\nCc: Vanamali, Sreeharsha (DS)\nSubject: Non-Compliance - Can we do something to fix this?\nImportance: High\n\nHi Andy,\n\nJust curious is the hardware/OEM (Xiomi MI3) blocked or any Apps on the Phones are blocked that we can fix for this user?
