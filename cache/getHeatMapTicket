Here's some background:\n\n*        The iPhones range from 4S, 5C and 6\n\n*        iOS range from 8.0.2, 8.1.0 and 8.1.1\n\n*        The iPhones that we've installed so far have only one email account (ToaRe email).\n\n*        To install AirWatch, we deleted the Exchange email account from the phone before installing AirWatch\n\n*        AirWatch MDM agent, Inbox, SCL and Self Service Portal were successfully installed\n\n\n\nHere's the issues that we need to resolve in order of importance:\n\n1.      In the AW Inbox, we cannot edit or delete existing contacts. There is no button\/option to press (or we don't see one) to edit or delete contacts. How do we then edit or delete entries in the AirWatch Contact list?\n\n2.      We would like to export selected contacts from the AW Inbox to the phone's native contacts. In some of the iPhones, the only option is to 'Export All'; in the other phones we cannot even get the Export All option at all.\n\n3.      Since ToaRe email was moved to AirWatch, native contacts for the phone is now empty. All contacts moved into the AirWatch contacts list. The problem is when a call is received, when texting or looking into the call\/text history, the phone number exists and is displayed but no names. Is there a setting in AirWatch so that contacts in the AirWatch inbox is displayed when receiving a call or when texting?\n\n4.      Not all the fields that are in Outlook Contact came down to AirWatch; such as addresses and notes. Does AirWatch bring down only selected fields? If so, which fields are those?\n\n5.      We have some users who want their phones to synch email for more than 3 days (which is the setting that we've set up in AirWatch). Is there a way to give a different synch interval for a user without setting up a policy.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you need additional information to help resolve these issues.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nAmy\n\nAmmeline C.

They have contracted ATT to stage all the IPAD. They are spending 20K a day for each day the deployment is delay. The deployment is already past due.  \n\nSo on to the issue - Currently, when DEP devices enroll, the auto apps are not being pushed to the devices immediately. Gene (POC for AirWatch) and I enrolled a device around 1 PM and the application still have not been pushed. Later, we manually push the apps to the devices from the console and the application did install. \n\nCurrently we have 66 devices enrolled to Retail Org ( Michael Kors \\ Production \\ Retail). Out of the 66 devices, we are missing auto push apps on atleast 3-6 apps.  See the stats for Not Installed \/ Installed \/ Assigned for the auto push apps below:\n\n1. AW SCL 6 \/ 60 \/ 66\n2. AW Browser 3 \/ 63 \/ 66\n3. AW MDM Agent 4 \/ 62 \/ 66\n\n\nOne other thing to note, there is a discrepancy between Not Installed \/ Installed \/ Assigned count. See the attached screenshots. So when I access Public Apps access from Apps & Book \\ List View, I get Screenshot A. When I search for \u201cAirWatch\u201d in the search list under list view, I get Screenshot B.
