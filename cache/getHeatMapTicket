Whitelist of devices cannot be updated. - They have a whitelist of devices so that only authorized devices can be enrolled but they were unable to add new devices into the whitelist due to the issue. The root cause has not been found yet but we found a workaround which is to restart the message queue and purge the command if there are some commands stuck in the queue. We monitor the queue because it happened once before but we could not catch the issue again. They are now strongly requesting to find out the root cause and fix the issue, and monitor the queue with proper threshold to prevent the issue from happening again and notice the issue if it happens again.\n\n{Justification and impact}: \n<Production Impact \/ Deal Breaker \/ # Users affected \/ Customer Temp>\nAs soon as the issue with the AD was resolved, they tried to enroll the devices again but since they were unable to add the new devices to the whitelist, they were again unable to enrol the devices.\nThey are very upset because they needed to enrol the new devices for the new users and prepared for the enrollment but they were unable to do it for a while whereas it was supposed to finish within a day.\n\n{What help do you need from REM?} (Help to escalate internally, Reach out to customer etc.):\nThe client is requesting to provide an RCA on this issue by tomorrow (11\/Mar) morning JST.\n\n{Customer Name & Contact}: Phone\\email\n\u5e73\u7530 \u525b\uff08\uff29\uff23\uff34\u30a4\u30ce\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u672c\u90e8\uff09 -
