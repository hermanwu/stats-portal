This may not have been the correct method to host locally.\nUsed a Self Signed Server Certificate - Worked.\n\n\n**Screenshots & Logs (must attach to the ticket)**:\nAttached.\n\n\n**Additional Notes \/ Information**:\nComputing Signature is the signing of the Profile.  When this takes 40+ seconds it causes the enrollment to timeout. Sometimes it's over a minute. If you spam the login, you will have smooth performance for 30 minutes then the problem returns.\nNeed assistance reviewing the CAPI2 logs and determining why we are consistently seeing lengthy computing signatures timing in the logs.  Possibly an intermittent connection problem to retrieve the CRL but we need to prove it.  This problem has persisted for 4-5 months. Case is Urgent\/High due to client unable to enroll during this time.\n\n##########################################\n\nNext Steps:\n1.

They have contracted ATT to stage all the IPAD. They are spending 20K a day for each day the deployment is delay. The deployment is already past due.  \n\nSo on to the issue - Currently, when DEP devices enroll, the auto apps are not being pushed to the devices immediately. Gene (POC for AirWatch) and I enrolled a device around 1 PM and the application still have not been pushed. Later, we manually push the apps to the devices from the console and the application did install. \n\nCurrently we have 66 devices enrolled to Retail Org ( Michael Kors \\ Production \\ Retail). Out of the 66 devices, we are missing auto push apps on atleast 3-6 apps.  See the stats for Not Installed \/ Installed \/ Assigned for the auto push apps below:\n\n1. AW SCL 6 \/ 60 \/ 66\n2. AW Browser 3 \/ 63 \/ 66\n3. AW MDM Agent 4 \/ 62 \/ 66\n\n\nOne other thing to note, there is a discrepancy between Not Installed \/ Installed \/ Assigned count. See the attached screenshots. So when I access Public Apps access from Apps & Book \\ List View, I get Screenshot A. When I search for \u201cAirWatch\u201d in the search list under list view, I get Screenshot B.

Before the AirWatch application was upgraded a snapshot was taken of the AirWatch VM\/Server. This was requested from AirWatch. \n\nEarlier today we found that the AirWatch VM has two snapshots dating back as far as two months ago (specifically November 4th, 2014). The two snapshots have created an almost 30G transaction log also known as a \"Delta disk\" or -delta.vmdk.\n\n\nThese two snapshots need to be \"committed\" as soon as possible.\n\n\nThe current snapshots in place do not follow VMware's Best Practice and prevent the VM from being migrated as needed using either vMotion or Storage vMotion.\n\nWe need to work with the AirWatch support team to...\n\n1) Understand the types of data unique to each AirWatch install. Ex. DB, Config, etc.\n\n\n2) Complete a full and confirmed backup of this unique AirWatch data.\n\n\n3) Commit the two snapshots on the AirWatch VM \"AW1.\" and\n\n\n4) Confirm the proper operation of the AirWatch VM after successfully committing these snapshots.\n\n\nAny snapshot of a VM limits other advanced features from being available to that same VM. Ex. vMotion. The current snapshot as it is poses a performance and consolidation risk to the Server\/VM.\n\nLook forward to working with you.\n\nThanks,\n\nWarren\n\n\n\n>>> AirWatch Support <support@air-watch.com> 11\/03\/2014 3:39 PM >>>","priority":null,"status":"new","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":700257873,"submitter_id":713455728,"assignee_id":null,"organization_id":36069677,"group_id":20045507,"collaborator_ids":[342241503,553389553,659435088,704512377,833616633,713455728,713455718,713455708],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","na","not_support","on_premise","upgrade__production","web_form","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":"4.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":"4.5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"not_support"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket","organization_Name":"City of Ocala Police Department","temperature":"yellow"},{"url":"https:\/\/airwatch.zendesk.com\/api\/v2\/tickets\/490083.json","id":490083,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"tfoy@sabra.com","name":"Terry Foy"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-05T22:11:23Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T17:21:23Z","type":"incident","subject":"Sabra Airwatch Tunnel stopped working","raw_subject":"Sabra Airwatch Tunnel stopped working","description":"Air watch Tunnel was working for a couple of weeks and stopped just before Christmas, now no one can access the Airwatch Tunnel.\n\nHere is what I have done to troubleshoot:\n\n1) Check vpnd service and ran the vpn.log tail command\n2) Reboot server and check vpnd service and ran the vpn.log tail command\n3) Sending information to you now with log information\n\n************************************************************\n[root@pk10awt01 airwatch]# cd vpnd\n[root@pk10awt01 vpnd]# ps aux |grep vpn\nnobody    1357  0.1  0.5 1332604 9876 ?
