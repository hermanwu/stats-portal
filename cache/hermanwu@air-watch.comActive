I’d like this setup so we can use another registration address for these users to automate the ActiveSync account creation on their devices.  The domain remains the same, it’s just another Exchange server that these users connect to for Activesync.  Please let me know if it would be better to setup a quick call.\"\n","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":823340796,"submitter_id":594757567,"assignee_id":594757567,"organization_id":35696336,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","customer","email","enhanced","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn274___na___trial_production"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":""},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"email"},{"id":20282146,"value":""},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":""},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/492254.json","id":492254,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-08T15:08:34Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T16:03:21Z","type":"incident","subject":"BMC Software - GLOBAL (US) / iOS not syncing deleted mail","raw_subject":"BMC Software - GLOBAL (US) / iOS not syncing deleted mail","description":"Customer Name: Khiyam Siddiqui\nCompany Name: BMC Software - GLOBAL (US)\nTelephone Number: \nEmail Address: khiyam_siddiqui@bmc.com\nEnvironment: CN701\n\nCustomer Issue: One user that has iOS 5 8.1.2, when the user deletes emails from the iPhone the email never syncs with his email accounts in outlook etc... and after a while the emails show back up in his Native Email Client inbox on the iPhone.
