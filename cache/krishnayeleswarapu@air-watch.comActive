When the profile comes down, we have a notification from AirWatch to enter (and confirm) a password, but entering the correct password still shows an error in the Wi-Fi list \"Authentication error occurred\".\n\nIf I go into the settings of the profile, just re-entering the password doesn't allow the device to connect.  Only if remove the pre-filled Identity (which is correctly displayed), and re-enter it and the password, then am I able to connect.\n\nIf I pre-fill the username and password in the AirWatch profile, then the device can connect just fine.\n\nI reported this problem in tickets 431146 and 407477 and was told there is not an ETA for a fix.  Please let me know when this will be fixed?\n\nThe profile we've been working with in our environment is called DOT-Mobile Wi-Fi Android.\n\nThanks,\nErik Hooverson","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":275931431,"submitter_id":275931431,"assignee_id":758710276,"organization_id":22554966,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[613198807],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn16___na___production","support__console__profile_management__wifi_profile","support__product_defect"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn16___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__wifi_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"AAGNT-173111"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn16___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__wifi_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"AAGNT-173111"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":5}
