I am stuck on\nMachineMDMEnrollmentUserUPN.\n\nWhat would the userUPN be for a local standard user account named \"Student\"?\nShould I use the Airwatch user name (username@domain.com) that I will be\nusing to enroll all my machines with?\n\nIn my rollout, all the tablets have the same local standard user account\n\"Student\". All students use the local account \"Student\" to access their\ndevice. I plan to enroll all the devices using the same user name in\nAirWatch. Devices will be identified by a unique computer name.\n\nThe devices are all standlone and not connected to a domain.\n\nThanks.\n\nGene\n\nOn Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 7:24 AM, HaritPatel@air-watch.com\n<HaritPatel@air-watch.com> wrote:\n> Gene,\n> \n> Please find EOBO doc attached.
