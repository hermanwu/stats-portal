Re-pushing the ActiveSync profile temporarily resolves the issue, along with a full and clean re-enrollment, but most users call back a few days later with the same issue. Are they any known issues that could be attributing to this behavior? I heard one report that it was related to the AW app auto updating on the devices, but that seems unlikely since the issue has been reoccurring for many users.\n\nNone of our iOS devices appear to be having this issue, so it seems to be an Android only issue across multiple Samsung models.","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":501309403,"submitter_id":501309403,"assignee_id":598077373,"organization_id":22242513,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[962888333],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn16___na___production","support__console__profile_management__eas_profile","support__customer_error"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn16___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn16___na___production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__profile_management__eas_profile"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/490123.json","id":490123,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-05T23:47:38Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T22:03:53Z","type":"incident","subject":"Trying to enroll a VC5090 and VC70NO using the ON Demand and/or Side Loading","raw_subject":"Trying to enroll a VC5090 and VC70NO using the ON Demand and/or Side Loading","description":"1.
