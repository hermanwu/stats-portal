One of my users has complained that they can not see embedded images within touchdown.\n\nNitro Desk has provided the following response:\n\nTouchDown wont show embedded images in connection modes other than Activesync protocol.\n\nI would like to now if there is a way to spesify in the profile which is sent to devices to use the Active Sync protocal only (uncheck Exchange 2007 and 2003)?  If i manually make the change within touchdown i am effectivly bypassing the profile I created within AW and can not push the lic key to the devices. \n\nThanks,\n\nJoseph Mangiaracina","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":513724136,"submitter_id":513724136,"assignee_id":598077373,"organization_id":35702333,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[965075393],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_pt_gen","awid_pt_rsl","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","kb_pt","kb_pt_ms","kb_pt_pd","saas__saas_dedicated","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__device_platforms__android__email_container"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__android__email_container"},{"id":20488011,"value":".5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"PR-184295"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__device_platforms__android__email_container"},{"id":20488011,"value":".5"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":"PR-184295"},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":12}
