How are licenses calculate by AirWatch and how do I get an accurate number of licenses being used? Our on-premise portal shows we have more devices enrolled than what your portal says. However, we have many devices that have not been seen for more than 30 days and are many of the devices are devices that the end user has replaced. A support engineer several years ago recommended to us to send the enterprise wipe command to those devices and then not to delete them out of the portal. Is this a good practice and do we have to license that device that may not exist anymore?\n\n2. The second question we have is that we can’t seem to keep being logged into our on-premise portal. This has been an issue for several versions now. Each time we’ve upgraded I’ve asked the install engineer if they’ve seen it before but they haven’t. I will log into the system successfully and start to see the portal home page but then I would get kicked out before the page will fully load. This make take several attempts before it will keep me logged in. Once logged in I can work for a little bit and then it will kick me out again. Not sure what’s going on.\n\nMark\n\n--------\n\nThis e-mail contains Omaha Public Power District's confidential and proprietary information and is for use only by the intended recipient.

Ticket #545624 asks why these groups got deleted, as we can’t see any reason our side.\n\nSecond issue is now that we have recreated the Groups, when we move the devices back they fail the compliance check (it doesn’t seem to run), so we can’t re-deploy our apps. We need this urgently for around 200 iPads we are using in a national conference in France on Tuesday. Ticket for this issue is #545891.\n\nI would appreciate any help you can provide, this is a desperate (and high profile) situation for us.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDave\n\nMobile:+44 78 9999 3008\n\nThis email (including any attachment) is intended only for the use by the recipients named above and contains proprietary information that may be confidential, copyrighted and/or privileged.
