I’ve uploaded the capture and resulting data to our SFTP site, which you can access using the credentials I supplied earlier in the ticket. The excel spreadsheet includes the conversation data from the SEG and the session table from our Exchange VIP.\n\nIn that capture, there were 668 ports used by the SEG that did not receive a response from the A10 due to a pre-existing session on the A10. Of those 668 ports, 649 repeatedly attempt to connect on that port. This was a 21+ minute capture, and no resets were initiated by the SEG on those ports, even for those that initially attempted to connect within the first 10 seconds of the capture.\n\nI hope this provides you and your team with enough concrete data to indicate that, while the timeout may be working some of the time, it does not work all of the time. That’s what causes us to encounter the problems we’ve been having for the last two months.\n\nPlease give me a call if you need any additional clarification.\n\nThanks,\n\nTim Kubick\nMobile Device Specialist\nOhioHealth Information Services\nTim.Kubick@ohiohealth.com<mailto:Tim.Kubick@ohiohealth.com>\nWork: 614-788-3355\nCell: 216-262-0660\n\nFrom: AirWatch Support <support@air-watch.com<mailto:support@air-watch.com>>\nReply-To: AirWatch Support <support@air-watch.com<mailto:support@air-watch.com>>\nDate: Thursday, March 5, 2015 at 11:02 AM\nTo: Tim Kubick <tim.kubick@ohiohealth.com<mailto:tim.kubick@ohiohealth.com>>\nSubject: [AirWatch Support] Request #508420: [OhioHealth / Question about the SEG and Exchange port","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":734751586,"submitter_id":734751586,"assignee_id":723797518,"organization_id":20273727,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[598077373,731711237,130022591,821773423],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["ae_escalation","awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","no_update_in_5_days","phone","saas__cn274___na___trial_production","saas_cn274_trial_production_north_america","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__enterprise_integration__seg"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"phone"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__enterprise_integration__seg"},{"id":20488011,"value":"3.75"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"phone"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__enterprise_integration__seg"},{"id":20488011,"value":"3.75"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"brand_id":2336986,"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/536194.json","id":536194,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"andre.douyon@ses.com","name":"Andre Douyon"},"to":{"address":"support@air-watch.com","name":"AirWatch Support"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-03-13T19:01:36Z","updated_at":"2015-03-25T19:02:11Z","type":"question","subject":"unable to change auto-lock on iPad","raw_subject":"unable to change auto-lock on iPad","description":"Airwatch\n\nWe have a Device policy set called SES iPhone Passcode.
