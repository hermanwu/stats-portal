One of my guys said he saw a screen that mentioned Airwatch was doing maintenance; however, I haven't seen such a screen. \n\nIs AW under any type of maintenance or are you experiencing any system issues? I would expect an email from Airwatch to inform us of any scheduled maintenance so we can plan accordingly. The same goes with system issues.","priority":"normal","status":"open","recipient":null,"requester_id":895110316,"submitter_id":895110316,"assignee_id":708878177,"organization_id":21946212,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn366___na___trial_production___edu","support_console_dashboard_devices"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn366___na___trial_production___edu"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_dashboard_devices"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn366___na___trial_production___edu"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_dashboard_devices"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/492578.json","id":492578,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-08T19:43:47Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T21:22:38Z","type":"question","subject":"Domain based administrator missing from AW console, but unable to add manually because he exists","raw_subject":"Domain based administrator missing from AW console, but unable to add manually because he exists","description":"Hello,\n\nOne of my administrators europe\\aadminv-arcase is in an AD group that we tie to a given Admin Role.
