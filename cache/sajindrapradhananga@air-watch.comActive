It seems that all phones running android 4.4.2 won’t allow it. Every phone I checked that has 4.2.2 will allow fed emails. The difference seems to be in the server policy “allow soft certificate”. 4.4.2 phones have it disabled and 4.2.2 have it enabled and there’s no ability to change it on the phone.\n\nThere’s one exception to the rule so far. My phone had 4.2.2 and would open emails and the soft certificate was allowed. I upgraded to 4.4.2 and my phone still allows the soft certificate. \n\nHopefully this info helps.\n\nThanks.\n\nJeff Toth | Radio Telecommunications Specialist 2\nDepartment of Military and Veterans Affairs \nBureau of Information Technology \nFort Indiantown Gap | Bldg S-0-47 Annville, PA  17003-5002\nPhone:  717.861.9278| Fax: 717.861.9652\nEmail: jetoth@pa.gov \n\n\nFrom: Setliff, Scott \nSent: Wednesday, January 28, 2015 9:23 AM\nTo: Toth, Jeffrey\nCc: Oberheim, Daniel\nSubject: RE: federal email\n\nLast email I saw on it from October was LG saying their MDM functions did not allow for personal certs to be used with email and was going to work with AW to determine the best way to address it.
