I'm curious what happens when someone's password gets changed.\nFrom what I recall, no new password needs to change on the mobile device (which seems strange to me).  Otherwise, I assume it would just prompt me for the new password.","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":409582611,"submitter_id":409582611,"assignee_id":708878177,"organization_id":25681912,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","enhanced","green","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_ft","saas__saas_dedicated","saas_dedicated","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support__enterprise_integration__authentication__directory","top150"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__enterprise_integration__authentication__directory"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__saas_dedicated"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__enterprise_integration__authentication__directory"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/491726.json","id":491726,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-01-07T20:17:03Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T14:50:03Z","type":"question","subject":"SQL Server 2012 or 2014","raw_subject":"SQL Server 2012 or 2014","description":"For on-premise installations, what are the currently supported versions of SQL that AirWatch works with?","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":275008006,"submitter_id":275008006,"assignee_id":708878177,"organization_id":20754857,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","datacenter_operations__server_operations__server_upgrade_request","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","ranking:a","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"datacenter_operations__server_operations__server_upgrade_request"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"datacenter_operations__server_operations__server_upgrade_request"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/491694.json","id":491694,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"to":{},"from":{"ticket_id":null,"subject":null},"rel":"follow_up"}},"created_at":"2015-01-07T19:50:23Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T20:11:24Z","type":"question","subject":"RE: [AirWatch Support] Request #484539: International Paper Company / Admin unable to login to console","raw_subject":"RE: [AirWatch Support] Request #484539: International Paper Company / Admin unable to login to console","description":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #484539 \"International Paper Company...\"\n\nI am back in the office and would like to see if we can get some assistance on getting this admin the ability to login.\n\nThe issue is with our test environment and seems to be related to the image validation piece that sometimes comes up with a login attempt.

We are unable to enroll Nokia Lumia Windows Phone 8 devices and same devices are not checking in","description":"To address the POODLE vulnerability with SSL, our security team made an internal change to disable our ciphers that use SSL 3.0. Since making that change, we noticed some (not all) Windows Phone devices stopped checking in with AirWatch. When we attempt to query the phone, it still does not check in even though the AirWatch app on the device shows a status of enrolled.  We are also unable to enroll certain Windows Phone devices. For example, when attempting to enroll a Nokia 635, the associate enters the server & Group ID, but receives a message \"Server connection not available\". OS is 8.10.12397.895. We currently use EIS (see attachment for settings.) What would be the repercussion of switching from SSL to TLS under EIS > Directory Services > LDAP to test as a fix? Would this break enrollment for iOS devices? We are on prem. w/version 7.1.1.4. The other piece is....we're thinking the next Microsoft OS release for Windows Phone 8 may resolve this but want to understand our options.\n\nKind regards,\nTodd","priority":"normal","status":"solved","recipient":null,"requester_id":276683666,"submitter_id":276683666,"assignee_id":708878177,"organization_id":20261258,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","support__customer_error","support__infrastructure__networking__ssl_certs"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__infrastructure__networking__ssl_certs"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__infrastructure__networking__ssl_certs"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket"}],"facets":null,"next_page":null,"previous_page":null,"count":11}
