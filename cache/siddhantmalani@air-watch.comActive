Is it possible to force SCL to use the sdcard as a storage location, either as a supplement or exclusively, so we can push more content to these users?\n\nAlso, currently, once we push more than ~2.5Gbs of content through SCL to our tablets, SCL begins to delete previous content and function very very slowly.  Whether or not the sdcard method is possible, could you suggest any possibilities for how we can avoid this issue? What is SCL's standard behavior when the device begins to fill up or there is a lot of content being made available through the app?\n\nThanks!\nErick","priority":"normal","status":"open","recipient":null,"requester_id":545471563,"submitter_id":545471563,"assignee_id":700529358,"organization_id":35640887,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","enhanced_support","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","na","no_update_in_5_days","on_premise","solved_ticket_macro","support__customer_error","support_scl"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_scl"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_scl"},{"id":20488011,"value":"0.2"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__customer_error"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"brand_id":2336986,"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/509852.json","id":509852,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-02-04T21:58:10Z","updated_at":"2015-02-20T20:01:37Z","type":"question","subject":"Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited / AW Browser issue with MAG tunneling","raw_subject":"Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited / AW Browser issue with MAG tunneling","description":"Jason, \n\nThis ticket has been in order to have an Agent troubleshoot your AW Browser issue with browsing while using your MAG. \n\nRegards,\n\nAhmed","priority":"normal","status":"pending","recipient":null,"requester_id":339926441,"submitter_id":720049436,"assignee_id":700529358,"organization_id":22850502,"group_id":21232998,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","call_follow_up","customer","enhanced","green","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","no_update_in_5_days","on_premise","security__customer_misconfiguration","solved_ticket_macro","support_secure_browser","web_form"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_secure_browser"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.0"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"security__customer_misconfiguration"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"web_form"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_secure_browser"},{"id":20488011,"value":"1.0"},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"security__customer_misconfiguration"},{"id":24078056,"value":"green"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"brand_id":2336986,"result_type":"ticket"},{"url":"https://airwatch.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/518833.json","id":518833,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"api","source":{"from":{},"to":{},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2015-02-18T20:21:55Z","updated_at":"2015-02-21T05:35:53Z","type":"incident","subject":"Bank of Montreal / KNOX - can't deploy Activesync emakil profile","raw_subject":"Bank of Montreal / KNOX - can't deploy Activesync emakil profile","description":"Issue is in on premises QA.
