(see attached image of wifi profile)\n\nComputer technologies is using intermac devices. Since we do not have an available intermac (honeywell) device in the office, we are not able to replicate issue. Wifi profiles are pushing to our test symbol device and awcm status is ok on both the customers device and our test device. I am now sending this through support in order to troubleshoot more in depth. \n\n**Device Side Troubleshooting Steps Attempted:**\n\n- Airwatch diagnostics \u2013 Made sure incoming and outgoing information was being sent on rugged device\n- Made sure awcm status was ok on device inside admin console\n- Made sure push notification works from console to device\n- Confirmed airwatch application has 200 ok on Windows Mobile Device\n- In airwatch diagnostics on device>went to beacon tab>clicked \u201cbeacon now\u201d\n\n**AirWatch Console Troubleshooting Steps Attempted**\n\n- confirmed that profiles are pushing to device by creating a Launcher profile. The launcher profile is locking the device to a single app. (internet explorer). \n- confirmed profile says \"pending install\" and that the xml code says \"auto\" rather than \"on demand\"\n- The customers device did not have a manually configured wifi profile outside of AirWatch with the same SSID.\n- Checked event log on device and the device services logs but did not see any errors in event log or device services after trying to push profile. We did not verbose the device services logs as it was at the end of our last troubleshooting call and we ran out of time.\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul Yates\nDeployments\n","priority":"normal","status":"closed","recipient":null,"requester_id":802370136,"submitter_id":624764966,"assignee_id":728280393,"organization_id":36231073,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[624764966],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["bundled_programs__green__on_premise","closed_by_merge","customer","deployments","on_premise","problem_ticket","support__product_defect","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"deployments"},{"id":20282146,"value":"bundled_programs__green__on_premise"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"deployments"},{"id":20282146,"value":"bundled_programs__green__on_premise"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__product_defect"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket","organization_Name":"","temperature":"yellow"},{"url":"https:\/\/airwatch.zendesk.com\/api\/v2\/tickets\/453265.json","id":453265,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"to":[],"from":{"ticket_id":null,"subject":null},"rel":"follow_up"}},"created_at":"2014-10-31T15:15:32Z","updated_at":"2014-10-31T20:16:00Z","type":null,"subject":"Re: [AirWatch Support] Request #446593: Denver Post \/ Personal Calendar","raw_subject":"Re: [AirWatch Support] Request #446593: Denver Post \/ Personal Calendar","description":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #446593 \"Denver Post \/ Personal Cale...\"\n\nare you available this am from 9:00 am - 11:00 am mdt ?","priority":null,"status":"closed","recipient":"support@air-watch.com","requester_id":651966216,"submitter_id":651966216,"assignee_id":817618113,"organization_id":20257957,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[817618113],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["awid_cust","closed_by_merge","customer","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","saas__cn274___na___trial_production","solved_ticket_macro","support","support__usability","support_console_dashboard_devices","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"support"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_dashboard_devices"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__usability"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"saas__cn274___na___trial_production"},{"id":20280868,"value":"support"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support_console_dashboard_devices"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":"support__usability"},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"followup_ids":[],"result_type":"ticket","organization_Name":"","temperature":"yellow"},{"url":"https:\/\/airwatch.zendesk.com\/api\/v2\/tickets\/449359.json","id":449359,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"to":[],"from":{"ticket_id":null,"subject":null},"rel":"follow_up"}},"created_at":"2014-10-27T13:58:25Z","updated_at":"2014-11-01T19:01:11Z","type":"incident","subject":"Re: Device in Compromised Status","raw_subject":"Re: Device in Compromised Status","description":"Customer Name: Julie Simons\nCompany Name: Juno Lighting, LLC\nTelephone Number: 317-558-4273\nEmail Address: jsimons@junolightinggroup.com\nEnvironment: CN16\n\nCustomer Issue: This is a follow up to the previous ticket #434798.

Since last week we started to have issue with the AirWatch portal, since I added 72 users, every time I enroll a new IPad, the results are different, this morning I did 3 iPad simultaneously and got 3 different results, the one that completed successfully was on iOS 8.01. is there an incompatibility between iOS 8.02 and AirWatch? Reason why I am asking, that successful tablet, I have wiped it, updated it to 8.02, now when I try to enroll it, no apps gets pushed to it. I have also  noticed a lot of slowness on the portal, even a week and a half ago, a complete freeze of the portal for about 5 min. we need your help ASAP, has we a rolling out those 72 tablets next week. Up to now, everything was running smoothly, but not anymore, we would like to get this working flawlessly and as stable as what we have subscribed to.\n\nThank you for your quick response\n\n_______________________\nMichel Bety Jr.\nSonepar Canada Inc.\nAdministrateur Syst\u00e8mes\n\nmailto:Michel.bety@sonepar.ca\nT:514.426.0629 poste 2021 | F:514.426.9122\n\nFrom: BETY Michel\nSent: Wednesday, October 15, 2014 8:29 AM\nTo: 'JeromeDambrin@air-watch.com'\nCc: valentino.nunes@sonepar.ca<mailto:valentino.nunes@sonepar.ca>\nSubject: Portail AirWatch\n\nBonjour Jerome,\n                J'esp\u00e8re que tout vas bien,  depuis la semaine derni\u00e8re j'ai des troubles avec mon portail, depuis que j'ai ajout\u00e9 72 utilisateurs,  \u00e0 chaque fois que j'enr\u00f4le un nouvel iPad , les r\u00e9sultat sont diff\u00e9rent.

Currently we have 569 devices deployed in Air Watch, with more be ordered weekly. Having our apps deployed properly and efficiently is paramount.  \n\nHere's a bit of history on our situation...\n\nInitially we were told that we could push out apps silently to all our devices. The reality was that we would have to hit install on every device for every app we had to push out. If you had a cart of 30 iPads with 60 apps you'd have to hit each device 60 times. Turns out that silent install is only true if you've supervised the device in Apple Configurator. So we began to supervise the devices and the apps started deploying silently. \n\nThe next problem arose when Apple encouraged us towards using individual iTunes accounts instead of the single account we had been using. This broke the silent install as each account needed to confirm the deployment through the input of the iTunes password. This meant that a tech or teacher needed to have all the devices on hand to be able to deploy an app, otherwise the deployment would time out.  It means that I've gone from having to press a group of 30 iPads 60 times to going through each Smart Group and clicking deploy 60 times. \n\nWe've also been having issues properly deploying purchased apps to devices using the redemption codes. In one particular instance we had a series of apps purchased and uploaded into the Air Watch console. The codes were assigned and the system said the had been redeemed by all the devices. The problem came when I received a call from the school a few weeks later saying that their apps hadn't deployed on all their devices. We put in a support call and the answer we received was that we needed to re-download the codes from Apple VPP and append the transactions in the console to redeploy the apps. This created quite the headache and it still hasn't totally remedied the situation.\n\nWe attempted the Managed Distribution model but the Air Watch console only every said Pending Installation. We're not entirely sure how the Managed Distribution works when all the devices are enrolled in Air Watch with one enroller account. Some help on this would potentially alleviate the headache of the Apple ID password and silent install. We're not entirely sure if this would or not. If it sends an invite email to the iTunes account then great. If it's to the enroller email then that's problematic as that account has no inbox to receive invitations.\n\nSo as time has gone one we've streamlined one portion of our process (Configuration of the devices) only to be met with continuing frustration of managing the apps in an efficient and timely manor to hundreds of devices.\n\nWe have close to 200 Samsung devices potentially joining the fray, they have their own app issues. So far we've been unable to search the entire Play Store for apps. Type in Angry Birds and totally unrelated apps appear. This would be an additional bonus if we could get that solved as well, coupled with any input on how to provision and deploy the devices.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nNick Martens\nTechnician (iPads\/Tablets)\nSchool District No. 23\n250-860-9729 ext: 8646","priority":"normal","status":"open","recipient":null,"requester_id":651319406,"submitter_id":651319406,"assignee_id":705872203,"organization_id":22561166,"group_id":21550038,"collaborator_ids":[481615158],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":["api","awid_cust","customer","kb_ag","kb_aw_tv","kb_frf","kb_frm","kb_pa","on_premise","support__console__application_management","yellow"],"custom_fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__application_management"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":20305738,"value":"on_premise"},{"id":20280868,"value":"api"},{"id":20282146,"value":"support__console__application_management"},{"id":20488011,"value":null},{"id":20448856,"value":null},{"id":24010713,"value":null},{"id":23964878,"value":""},{"id":24078056,"value":"yellow"},{"id":24035523,"value":null}],"result_type":"ticket","organization_Name":"","temperature":"yellow"},{"url":"https:\/\/airwatch.zendesk.com\/api\/v2\/tickets\/453069.json","id":453069,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"web","source":{"to":[],"from":{"ticket_id":null,"subject":null},"rel":"follow_up"}},"created_at":"2014-10-31T12:36:17Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T16:23:50Z","type":"question","subject":"RE: [AirWatch Support] Request #426706: Remote Control Managment On Android devices","raw_subject":"RE: [AirWatch Support] Request #426706: Remote Control Managment On Android devices","description":"This is a follow-up to your previous request #426706 \"Remote Control Managment On...\"\n\nGood Morning,\n\nI need this ticket to be re-opened.
